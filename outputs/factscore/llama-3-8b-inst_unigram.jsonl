He played a key role in Brazil's transition to democracy during the late 1980s, advocating for workers' rights and participating in negotiations that ended the military dictatorship.\n\nPresidential Campaigns:\n\nLula first ran for president in 1989, finishing third. In 1994, he lost again to Fernando Henrique Cardoso.

The HSMP was a militia group that later became known as the LRA.\n\nIn 1988, Kony declared that he had received divine guidance to overthrow the Ugandan government and to create a theocracy based on ten commandments that he received through visions from God. Under his leadership, the LRA began to carry out attacks against government targets, including soldiers, police officers, and civilians.\n\nThe LRA gained notoriety for its brutal methods, including kidnaping children to serve as soldiers and sex slaves, mutilation of victims, and rape of women and girls.
