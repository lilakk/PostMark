The period is designed, in principle, for a certain amount of time before an employer decides to retain the contract. During probation the employer will be able to see its employees at work and its abilities to be useful for its company. The trial or probation period is a period during which an employer can \"sunset\" or \"rainbow\" and dismiss workers without worrying. The probation period should allow the employer to see its employees in actual working conditions and to examine their work capacity. The termination of the contract is made within a certain number of months at a fixed time. The question of the duration and validity of the contract depends only on the written or oral labour agreement.

While on probation, the employer can observe the employees' performance and assess their suitability for the company. During the trial or probation period, employers have the flexibility to dismiss workers without concern. The probation period enables employers to observe employees in real work situations and evaluate their ability to perform tasks. The contract is terminated after a specific number of months at a set time. The length and legitimacy of the contract are determined solely by the written or verbal labor agreement.

{"prefix": "Q: - what is an ego death?\nA:", "gold": "It's the experience of losing track of your sense of self, typically in the context of using a psychedelic drug, but also potentially during intense meditation.\nThe Ego in this context is the Freudian concept of the Id, Ego, and Superego.  The Id operates in the subconscious - it's your instincts, your desire to feel pleasure, your primitive drive to survive.  The Ego is your sense of self, your self-esteem, your conscious decision making ability, your experience of reality.  The Superego is like your conscience - it's where morality, guilt and anxiety come from.\nSo, an ego death is a detachment from reality and from your sense of self.", "text1": " - Great Question. This takes a while to explain so please be patient.\nTechnically, ego death is when you feel you no longer have a coherent sense of self and your brain goes a bit haywire. It may be described as having a \"melt down\" or an \"nervous breakdown.\" It is often the result of intense feelings of guilt, anxiety, fear, shame, or anger. Basically, the ego reacts to a sense of impending annihilation, which feels like death.\nPsychiatrist Bill Manahan defines the ego as the \"self-esteem system\" of the brain and explains that, when confronted with stressful and traumatic events, the ego seeks to protect itself and will \"get you to change to avoid the bad feelings.\" The ego survives by distorting the truth and will manufacture lies and distortions of reality to make it work.\nWhen the ego's lies and distortions of reality become too big, a type of \"identity crisis\" occurs and the ego's identity ceases to exist. In this state, one experiences a loss of a sense of self.\nIn the great scheme of things, it doesn't really matter if the experience is temporary or permanent. What does matter is the perspective taken of the experience: In the face of annihilation, can we respond with compassion and curiosity?\nThere are certain conditions which tend to bring on ego death.

As the use of the term implies, the collapse or eradication of the sense of identity as the separative ego is what it's all about.\nIt is rather like a spiritual \"mikma qoa\" - what the Blackfoot call the moment of extreme psycho-spiritual transformation when life hangs on the edge between living and dying.\nAs long as the separative ego is holding sway as the organizing matrix that determines what and who one is - it's impossible to be who one is not and everything one knows, about oneself, and everything one has based one's life on, is revealed to be untrue, a false and delusive sense of identity, a false sense that one is a \"somethang\" rather than Nothing, or the Whole, the Absolute, etc. etc. The ego one has depended on to know and understand everything simply does not exist.

It can be compared to a spiritual transformation moment known as \"mikma qoa\" in Blackfoot culture, where life teeters on the brink between existence and death. The separative ego must be dominant for one to believe in a false sense of identity and everything they know about themselves to be untrue.

A classic example would be *\"we are not selling nuclear weapon technology to North Korea, every company doing that will be punished\"*.\n- Sanctions are not unusual. While they are often the last resort of countries short before a war, they are used by economic more influential countries on countries to stop human atrocities or of specific nations gaining economic power or technology which could destabilize an entire region. \n- In many cases sanctions are not obviously successful, but in some cases it forces a country to stop aggressive actions or at least back down. Often enough however they are used as a propaganda instrument from the affected country in order to galvanize the population ... and for the population of enforcing country \n- In many cases a country (lets call it A) would not interfere with trades between Countries B and C. The problem is: the world wide economy is connected internationally and many payment systems and trades are done via US bank and payment systems. With that the US has a certain pressure power to enforce sanctions even when the trade does not directly involve their own economy.\nRegarding Russia: Russia is currently threatening (more or less directly) to invade the Ukraine, and is involved with the Crimea Occupation and the destruction of MH17. With that both the EU and the US have imposed sanctions of various levels on Russia, as especially the EU would not like to have a full blown war next to their eastern border.

The Police HAVE to get involved. \nThus it becomes a business decision.  Walgreens is a multi-billion dollar company.  Someone stealing $50 of random crap from one store is such a small number that they probably accidentally lose that money in spare change under the seats of the CEO's private jet.

IE if I don't support the war on drugs, I may refuse to vote guilty on a charge for drug possession, even if I believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was committed.\nIt's use is pretty controversial; it's the job of Congress (and indirectly, the voters) to decide which laws are just and which are unjust, not twelve random jurors. In the past it's been used for some good, but also a lot of nasty stuff. But since jurors do not have to justify their votes, there is little that can be done to stop them unless they outright admit to it.", "text1": " Jury nullification means that a juror can ignore the law as told by the judge and based on his/her conscience, vote \u201cnot guilty\u201d in a case in which the law is clearly violated. Examples of this could be in cases where prosecutors are abusing their power or when individuals are victimized for their political beliefs, race, or because of fear. While jury nullification was once not allowed, it is now widely allowed and can happen anywhere.\nWhile no one wants to go to prison, it is worse to go for the wrong reason. It is a worse thing to do, but a lot better to go to prison for doing what you believe in than for something you did not do.\nIn the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), The Supreme Court ruled that private groups or corporations, such as corporations themselves or non-profits, may spend an unlimited amount of money on political campaign activities, such as political endorsements or running attack ads for candidates.\nTo do this they would normally have to be registered with the government as a political action committee, but in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission they ruled that the First Amendment of the US Constitution gives individuals and groups the right to spend whatever they want on their own political speech without being regulated by the government.\nTo put it in simple terms, it makes it very easy to spend a lot of money on political campaigns.", "text2": " Nullification occurs when people refuse for whatever reasons to convict a criminal. The reasons vary, but the end result can be the same: a refusal to convict.\nIn its original form, Nullification began when some individuals within a jury would refuse to convict a criminal. That act was called \"nullifying,\" which basically means you're ignoring the established rules or procedures of some system, and substituting your own, perhaps more individualized system.\nIn modern America, a jury nullifying verdict can be that jury refusing to convict a criminal regardless of the actual evidence against the criminal. The original jurors, in other countries and with the founding American colonists when they declared American independence, were basically allowed full autonomy over the jury trials of their neighbors. That is not the case today in the United States. The original jury trials from our Founders has been altered and is not the same in the United States. The trials have been turned into mini-trials, with all the same rules as for State and Federal trials. Thus, the powers given to the jury to nullify verdicts, and thus convict no one - no matter what the actual evidence against them is - has been stripped away. Nullification today, in America, means that a jury cannot bring back a verdict that nullify or excuse some individual, or series of individuals of criminal wrongdoing in the United States.", "text3": "Nullification happens when individuals choose not to convict a criminal for various reasons. The outcome remains consistent despite the differing reasons: a decision not to convict. Originally, Nullification started with certain jury members refusing to convict a criminal.

In contemporary America, jury nullification can occur when a jury chooses not to convict a criminal, regardless of the evidence presented. The original jurors in other countries and with the founding American colonists had complete control over the jury trials of their neighbors. Today in the United States, things are different. The jury trials established by our Founders have undergone changes and are no longer the same in the United States. The trials have been transformed into smaller versions with identical rules to State and Federal trials. Therefore, the ability of juries to nullify verdicts and choose not to convict anyone, regardless of the evidence, has been taken away.

While age of consent is usually 16 (or 18 in some cases) pedophelia occurs between an adult and a child, usually pre-pubescent. In most states it is extremely hard to make a case for pedophelia due to lack of physical evidence and due to the fact that the child could be lying. Some cases would require medical examination which isn't always done. Due to sexual abuse of children being hidden by pedophiles themselves they have to try to prove their case in court with little to no evidence.", "text2": " The topic is not about consent but rather the violation thereof and a particularly serious offense in line with the violence it may cause to the victim. Consent refers to the voluntary agreement of two consenting parties who are at least 16 year of age to participate, willingly, in sexual activity of any sort and agree to be involved in some sexual activity that will take place. Age of consent is when one is over 16 year of ages.\nPedophilia on the other hand is when an adult has relationship of some type with a minor. Pedophilia is also when an adult forms an interest in any type of physical or emotional sexual contact with a minor. When pedophiles have relationships or form a sexual interest in minors there is a criminal element involved; because there is an adult involved who can be charged for any violation pertaining to the sexual activity of the victim and therefore constitutes pedophilia, or child molestation. Pedophilia involves being interested in sexual activity of minors and is a crime, a criminal offense.\nIt may be that the male and his girlfriend in the picture below have agreed on having sex at a tender age and are consenting adults.\nAccording to the Ontario Provincial Police:\nThe Criminal Code of Canada outlines four instances of criminal sexual offences against children including non-contact offences, gross sexual offences, sexual offences against children or young people, and criminal offences committed against children by a parent, sibling, or step-parent.", "text3": "The focus is on the violation of consent and the severity of the offense in relation to the harm it can cause the victim.

Here in the UK, that age is 16. So if we have two people under 16 that have sex with each other, the law is essentially saying neither person was mature enough to make an informed decision either way on doing it. What this means is it would be very unfair to simultaneously say \"you didn't know what you were doing\" *and* \"we should punish you for doing it\".\nEdit: I should specify that the larger the age gap between the two underage participants, the less likely it is the older member will not be punished. For example, of it was two 15 year olds, then \"fair enough\", but if it was a 15 year old and an 11 year old, it would most certainly be considered an offence and dealt with accordingly.", "text1": " Your question depends on two premises. 1) Minors are not legally able to consent. 2) There is nothing wrong with 2 people of consenting age to have sex together.\nIf you change either premise, then you will find the answer to your question.\nWhen minors are said not to be able to consent, it is because it is assumed that they are not mature enough to understand the concept. \u00a0They are assumed to not be able to rationally make the decision.\nOf course, not all 18 year olds are rational and mature, and this is why the concept of consent exists. \u00a0Anyone who is in a relationship with an 18 year old, who is not legally able to consent, must take it upon themselves to understand whether the person is able to make rational decisions, and whether they are able to give true consent. \u00a0If they are not able to do so, then they cannot provide consent and are unable to legally have sex.\nThis is why it is possible for 2 minors to have sex. \u00a0The age limit for consent is a legal one, that applies to everyone. \u00a0The fact that some people are more mature and able to make better decisions does not mean that they can be held accountable under the law in the same way as people who are less mature and make bad decisions.\nAt the same time, a major can only have sex with another major if both are actually capable of providing consent.", "text2": " Ah, yes, the gray area for people deciding to \"sneak past sex laws\".

Both are minors and one can consent as he has enough rationality to \"not really\" understand the consequences of the act and is over influence line.

A gunman walked into the school and started shooting, killing 16 children and their teacher. The killer then turned the gun on himself.\nAs you may be aware, the school in Dunblane was the first elementary school in the UK to institute a zero-tolerance policy regarding firearms. This lead to a very firm stance against gun control. In 1997, the government enacted a total ban on handguns, which didn't have a bearing on the law because the school shooting didn't involve a handgun. The government also enacted other gun control measures, which haven't had a measurable effect on gun crime. The police have been given a bigger role in firearm licensing. Since 1997, there have been 73 gun crimes that have led to murder, compared to 19 before the 1997 law was put into effect.\nThe public has reacted favorably to the new gun control measures, but there is some doubt as to whether or not the guns could've been used by the killer to break into the school in 1996. Also, there were several lawsuits brought against the government by gun enthusiasts and dealers, but they were thrown out of court.", "text2": " Following a mass murder of school kids in America at Columbine, the UK banned all handguns, at least 19,000 guns in all.\nThere were 11 million firearms of some type in the country, a wide range in types, from airguns to hunting rifles, target pistols to shotguns.

Particularly if you believe you're innocent, there's some chance that...eventually...your conviction may be overturned. You can't overturn a completed death sentence.", "text1": " There are a number of reasons why a murderer would want to plead guilty and stay in prison for the rest of his life. In some states, if you are sentenced to death and the state fails to execute you, you will be released on parole. The justice system is very complex. The media often focuses on the most gruesome murders and is skewed to be anti-death penalty.\nPleading guilty and staying in prison for life isn\u2019t necessarily more comfortable than death row. While the conditions may be slightly better, there are still the long-term impacts. One of the most horrific experiences an inmate on death row can experience is watching friends and loved ones getting executed. Being on death row for an extended amount of time can be debilitating and cause an inmate to lose the will to live. Also, a murderer will lose whatever support they had from family and friends once they become known to the public as a murderer. There is a great risk to family and friends if they choose to stay in prison. They will have to relocate, change their names, and work hard to build new lives.\nFinally, why would a murderer want to stay alive in prison and watch as the world passes by them? In jail, a murderer has the opportunity to have sex with anyone who is willing, which is sometimes extremely easy.

With \"guilty until proven innocent,\" a defendant is considered guilty by society until he or she proves otherwise. By contrast, in our system, the burden of proof is on the government. To use our familiar metaphors, the presumption of innocence shifts the burden of proof to the prosecution; the presumption of guilt is the opposite.\nWhile the presumption of innocence serves a number of functions, its primary purpose is to recognize and minimize the inherent difficulty of proving someone innocent. You're presumed innocent until proven guilty. The prosecution, by contrast, does not have to prove you innocent at all -- they have the responsibility to prove you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nIt's important to note, too, that the term \"innocent\" has a technical meaning in the criminal justice system, and that meaning has little to do with morality. Legally, to be \"innocent\" simply means that the prosecution has not proven your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Being innocent, legally, is therefore much more difficult to prove than being guilty. Under the legal definition, the defendant doesn't have to do anything. By contrast, the prosecution must prove their case and establish all of the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nTo be guilty, legally, means that the prosecution has proven your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Why do you thing the UK was always accused of playing \"hard-ball tactics\" in court?\nIn American history, the prosecutors would just ask the jury to find the accused \"guilty\", and just hand out the death sentences, or life, or big fines -- it's not up to the jury to say \"guilty of what?\" or \"what evidence do you people have that I am guilty?

{"prefix": "Q: Mandatory arbitration\nA:", "gold": "Attorney here.  Normally when the parties to a contract are in a dispute, one of them can file a lawsuit in the courts to try to get the problem sorted out. Sometimes, the parties will agree to have someone smart and experienced but who is not a judge(an arbitrator) basically conduct an informal trial just like a judge, and the parties agree that they'll treat that decision just like it was done by a judge.  Agreeingto treat the arbitrator's decision just like a judge's decision is what makes the decision *binding.* \nThe parties can make the agreement to use an arbitrator at any time. Sometimes it might be after they start disputing and they both just figure it's faster and cheaper to use arbitration. In that situation, neither has to; if you'd rather use the courts, you can decline to arbitrate.  \n*Mandatory* arbitration is when you can ONLY resolve a dispute through arbitration. The agreement to skip the courts and only use arbitration almost always comes as part of signing the main contract.  So like when you enter a cell phone contract,  that contract will usually include a provision that says both sides agree that they'll only take their disputes to arbitration through so-and-so arbitration organization. \nMany people see this kind of arbitration as favoring the company because of the company is always having so-and-so organization doing the arbitration,  that's a lot of money for the organization,  and some people think that the organization is going to return the favor and make rulings in the company's favor.  \nSo why would anyone agree to mandatory binding arbitration?  It's because they essentially have no choice. You have the choice not to buy the product or enter the contract at all, of course... but if you do decide to enter that contract,  you're pretty much stuck with the contract terms. It's take it or leave it. In contracts where each side thinks the other is important enough,  they can negotiate and tweak certain parts. But in a deal between the average schlub and Blizzard, Blizzard isn't going to waste their time trying negotiating the contract. Take it or leave it, they say.  \nIn various places, laws have been passed to say that for some types of contract,  you must have the right to change your mind about mandatory arbitration, but will put a time limit on that.  So for instance, in my last cell phone contract I had 30 days after signing the contract to tell the phone company I didn't want to do mandatory arbitration. \nGetting rid of mandatory arbitration would mean that Activision/Blizzard might not be so confident about their chances of success in arbitration, in which case maybe they'd behave better toward their customers.", "text1": " Yes. In 1999, the Supreme Court decided a case called Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v.

Although the consumer had to sign a contract that required arbitration, the contract did not specifically mention arbitration of claims under state law, such as the double charging issue, which was the basis of the consumer\u2019s claim. The Supreme Court explained that this was not a barrier to the consumer\u2019s right to have his claim arbitrated. That is, even though the parties may have agreed to limit the scope of arbitration to disputes between the parties that arose out of the agreement, and even though the parties did not specifically mention arbitration of claims under state law, that limitation in the agreement is overcome in federal arbitration statutes if the claim at issue is \u201cwithin the scope or coverage of the arbitration agreement.\u201d\nThe Green Tree decision permits consumers to file their claims of illegal interest charges in an arbitration forum.

{"prefix": "Q: Why is crime increasing in Democratic cities?\nA:", "gold": "There are a lot of issues that contribute to this, some if it's policy related, some of it isn't.\nFirst, DAs are an elected position and the seat can be bought for practically nothing. Many DA seats have been taken over by activists who will drop criminal charges depending on who it is. Because of this, people feel like they have a chance to get away with it.\nThen there's the issue in some cities in California having a rule where any petty theft under $995 will not be pursued. This has lead to people shoplifting on mass because they know they can get away with it.\nTo add, being stuck in your house without a job can really tax on people. This is why a lot of people were going out and marching because despite covid, the marches themselves were not really policed in spite of people being really close to one another. This promoted people to be activists even when they didn't believe or really understand what was going on. Now that the activism has slowed down due to the election being over, people are still used to wondering the streets and given that they've been told they live in a racist system and that capitalism is evil, it's not a surprise that many people would vandalize places in these cities.\nAlthough the weather isn't as much of a factor, it is getting nicer out so people are going out more. A lot of crime is spontaneous, you see a house, no one is watching, you wrap your head in a shirt and break in to steal some shit.\nNot to mention that covid killed a lot of jobs and now that people have been not working for several months, people have decided that they don't want to work, which has caused a labor shortage. This leads to people being overworked because the jobs they do still demand work from them only now there's less help, and that causes stress, frustration, and that might be channeled from the previous point on being an activist. It can also just result in fights breaking out, people are on edge and there's a lot of division in the country right now.\nAnd no, it's not just the summer, places like NYC have a jump in crime %22 compared to this time last year.

{"prefix": "Q: Repudiation Attack\nA:", "gold": "Let's start with the simplest attack, and work up to the more complex.\nAlice owns a bank.  Bob somehow gains access ( dumpster diving for passwords on paper, or threatening Alice employee, etc ).  Bob then can steal information,  This is known as an ACCESS ATTACK.  The downside ( from Bob's point of view  ) is that Bob has information, but he has to engage in some second activity to monetize it.\nSuppose Bob wants to do a bit more, particularly if he wants to damage Alice's bank.  He goes to his stockbroker, buys puts ( contracts that guarantee the sale of a stock at a certain price ) then changes Alices web page.  Bob has graduated from reading data to writing data.  This is known as a MODIFICATION ATTACK.\nWhen the world reads that Alice's web page that now openly supports Stormfront, her stock tanks, and Bob buys the stock at a low price, invokes the contract with his broker, and sells at a high price.  This is riskier than a simple access attack because there are now clear traces showing how Bob profited.  There is also the downside that Alice will be very aware that she has been attacked, and this will lead her to harden her defenses, and to call the cops.\nSo Bob may add a new wrinkle.  He not only modifies information in Alice's database, but he then defrauds Alice directly, using her corrupted data against her.   **It is this direct, post-modification contact that make Bob's actions a REPUDIATION ATTACK**.\nBob, in preparation for the attack, took out a loan with Alice's bank.  When he does his modification attack, he changes Alice's records to show that he paid off the loan.  When Alice's bank requests the regular monthly payment from Bob, Bob calls up Alice's customer service, and informs them that they made a mistake.  They check their records, and decide that the loan is indeed paid off.\nSo Bob walks away with free money.    The upside of the repudiation attack is that if Bob has done it skillfully, Alice may never know.  Bob may be able to do it multiple times.\nThe downside - from Bob's point of view - of a repudiation attack is that he has to give up some contact information to Alice.  If Alice's security people are on their toes, they might be able to trap Bob.\nSuppose that Charlie, Alice's data security officer, is indeed on his toes.  Prior to Bob's attack, Charlie wrote a maintenance program that runs in the background, checking all alleged payments.   Any time a payment is recorded as having been made, Charlie's program attempts to match the payment with ACH records from whichever bank was the other party in the transfer.\nAny time that the maintenance program detects a problem, it sends a text message to Charlie.  When Bob commits his modification attack, Charlie knows about it within minutes.\nCharlie contacts Dave, the agent who works in the financial crimes division of the local FBI office.  Charlie has Bob's telephone number from the call to customer service, and Bob's social security number and home address from the loan application.  Dave then gets a warrant to search Bob's premises.\nDave then goes...well, we are getting a bit off topic now.  We will leave Dave and Bob to their cat and mouse games.  The important point here is that a repudiation attack involves post-attack involvement with the victim, and therefore can be very risky.", "text1": " All clients first have a copy of the repository server ID for trust. When you deploy a project, you request that the files be locked so you can work on them, and then, as a last step, you sign the new data you just checked out with your ID, not the server's. This works well for you, the project owner. No one else can come along, read your changes, copy the changes, and then claim that they made the changes. They cannot successfully cheat you out of your work, and they have a means to certify the authenticity of the data. The key to the whole system is that anyone can then audit this process to see if you really are the project owner.\nRepudiation attacks occur when the file's creator denies that the file is his own. In Git, a file's creator is tracked as a record, rather than by a signature on the data itself. The creator does not automatically have to be the person creating the current record, nor does he have to be in possession of the file.

I am appealing to my opponent by using the authority of someone as my argument.\nHowever, if I said \"I have COVID because my doctor gave me a test that detected the virus in my body,\" that's not an appeal to authority because my argument hinges on my positive COVID test as evidence, not on the credentials of the doctor.", "text1": " In a logical debate, an appeal to authority fallacy is when the subject attempts to win an argument with the arguer admitting his superior knowledge on the subject being argued and not using his arguments at all.

Squatter has actually provided value to the community and is viewed by the law as deserving the land more than Owner does.

In some cases this is because they have not taken responsibility for the crime they committed, and the fact that they are a repeat offender would mean that it is necessary to take action to prevent any further risk to the public.\nThe only place I've ever heard of a 200 year sentence is California for 3 strikes. In 1993 California had a crime wave where a lot of murder, rape, robbery, and theft were committed. So, in 1994 the three strikes law was enacted that states if you are a habitual felon you will get life imprisonment if you commit a \"serious\" crime. So, even though a person may have committed a minor crime, if they have 2 previous felonies they will receive a life sentence. Unfortunately, this law has been misused a lot because it was so hard to get a three strikes conviction that a lot of low level felons got life sentences.\nSomeone might have committed 5 different crimes, even 1 murder and 4 other felonies. They get arrested and each crime would result in a new trial.

Sociopathy can include a knack for social interaction, but there\u2019s no empathy; someone on the autistic spectrum might be awkward or not, but they\u2019ll likely be loyal to their own detriment, a sociopath sees you as a tool of convenience to be discarded when no longer needed.\nThere\u2019s no connection between the two, that I know of.", "text1": " There is no difference between the two terms\nQ: Can the diagnosis be made based on interview alone?\nA: Interview is an important tool of diagnosis. As in any medical diagnosis, you gather as much information as possible, usually from multiple sources. You must review the medical history, and carry out a physical examination. However, you must not over rely on the patient or parent reporting of the symptoms. You must make your own observations. For example, if a child is reported to have strange responses to touch, you must put the child in front of you and see the behavior for yourself.\nQ: When is the diagnosis of asperger's first made?\nA: The diagnosis of Asperger syndrome is often made at a very young age. The diagnosis is made easier with children since parents can remember their child's milestones of development and note any differences that occur. This information, along with information from teachers and friends of the family is usually enough to make the diagnosis at a very young age.\nHowever, many people with Asperger's syndrome are not diagnosed until adulthood. The behaviors that lead to the diagnosis may have been considered typical for the individual. For example, people may think that they are just strange people, and not that they are part of a syndrome.\nQ: Can adults be diagnosed with asperger's syndrome?\nA: It is not possible to accurately diagnose asperger's syndrome in adults.", "text2": " there are similarities, but also many things which would put these diagnoses at polar opposite. Aspergers syndrome, for example tends to be much more intellectualized, more obsessions, and overall, often characterized as 'having a mind of their very own'. They get into bigger academics, and tend to need to pick apart stuff very quickly but run through it very quickly as they move into other areas. These tend to be very sophisticated thinkers who can be quirky and get easily lost. ASD tends to be much more social and people-friendly. They tend to be non-verbal more often than verbal, and want to be connected to their body. As a treatment goal for people with ASD it makes sense that movement and body-oriented therapies would be central to their experience - I think in general we have found that people with more neurological and social needs would rather have someone care with them than intellectual or academic pursuits. We see more of an expression of their unique body and social life where as the 'nerdy' individual seems much more 'nerdy'.", "text3": "There are some similarities, but also many differences that would make these diagnoses completely different.

These individuals are highly intellectual and unique, often displaying eccentric behavior and becoming easily distracted. Autism Spectrum Disorder is generally more focused on social interactions and being friendly towards others. They often have difficulty with verbal communication and seek a strong connection with their physical self.

How do you tell them apart?\nA: The offense runs players onto the field and takes them off the field in what is called a \"formation.\" The formation consists of one or more runners (i.e., backs and the quarterback) and three or more receivers (i.e., wide receivers, slotbacks and tight ends). The player with the football is a runner. When a runner crosses the line of scrimmage and hands the ball off to a teammate, he is a receiver and the new runner becomes the receiver. If the runner drops back to pass the ball, he is a receiver for the duration of the play.\nQ: What is a \"sideline\"?\nA: The sidelines are the portions of the field that are not the field of play. The field of play extends from the sideline to the other sideline. Anything that happens on the sideline is illegal and must be penalized.

If the lines run east/west and northeast and if the south/west side of the field is more restrictive, but the players are standing on the north/south lines just the north/south lines will be used.\nQ: What does it mean if the last two defenders do not have any other defenders between them?\nA.

{"prefix": "Q: why can somebody get away with crimes in the Zone Of Death in Yellowstone?\nA:", "gold": "Because it's a national park, crimes committed on it cannot be tried in state courts, they have to be tried in federal courts. Under the constitution, the jury for these trials need to consist of individuals from both the court district and state the crime was committed in. That small area of the park that extends outside the borders of Wyoming are still part of a Wyoming court district, but part of the state of Montana or Idaho. Therefore, the jury would need to come from that specific small piece of land on which nobody lives, and therefore a jury would not be able to be found and the trial could not occur.\nIn practice, there would probably be a quick decision by the Supreme Court expanding the area that the jury could be assembled from and the case would proceed normally.", "text1": " Basically because it is easier to do so. It would also depend on whether the person was aware of the laws and made an active effort to escape justice. If so, it would be reasonable to say the person is guilty of a crime. It would also depend on the willingness of the people around the crime to cooperate. If enough people (cops, jurors, etc.) were willing to cooperate, they could prevent any escape.\nIs there a no-go zone in Yellowstone?\nNo. The general area may be called the Yellowstone Park Zone. Basically, this is an area inside the park that is unavailable for the general public. The only area that would be illegal to enter is the Yellowstone Caldera, which is a scientific zone and not a law enforcement zone.\nWhat were the crime rates in Yellowstone National Park in 2005?\nOf course, the most common crime is bear attacks. It is estimated that in 2005 there were a total of 150,000 bear attacks. On average, one bear attack occurs every five minutes. There are also many cases of muggings, robbery, burglary and vandalism.\nCan someone get away with murder in Yellowstone National Park?\nProbably not. Park law enforcement personnel and other agencies would be involved. If you really wanted to get away with it, you would have to kill the victim in the park.

{"prefix": "Q: What is qualified immunity in law enforcement and how does it work?\nA:", "gold": "The US Supreme Court decided that since people make mistakes, particularly cops, there should be a whoopsie card that can be played sometimes in civil court to protect the cop (or other public entity). Qualified Immunity can apply to any person acting under \u201ccolor of law\u201d to include school teachers, administrators, firefighters, and elected officials( and way more). Obviously it\u2019s not a real card, but a theory and legal defense. You get the idea. The card can only be played in civil court, not criminal court. It can be requested to be played (by the cop or other person getting sued) and a judge (or judges) has to agree that it can be played. \nThe card can only played if someone\u2019s civil rights were actually violated and those rights were not \u201cclearly established\u201d by law or legal precedent (precedent meaning it has been addressed in court before and a court made a legal decision on it already).\nThe card, when allowed to be played in court, says that, yes, a cop or some other public entity screwed up and made a mistake and violated someone\u2019s civil rights. That  person that violated the rights won\u2019t be held liable in a federal civil court (immune from lawsuit) because the screw up was something that was not clearly established already. In essence, that person made a reasonable mistake. \nWhen the Supreme Court came up with the idea of Qualified Immunity, it said that the idea was to protect people doing their jobs in good faith from being sued frivolously all the time. Meaning, a cop or some other public figure can do their jobs without being afraid of getting sued for anything and everything. Otherwise those public figures would not be able to do their job because they would get sued in civil court all the time for stupid stuff. The Supreme Court said that QI is not intended to be a blanket of protection for everything and does not cover cops (or others) who knowingly violate someone\u2019s rights or reasonably should have known that those rights were clearly established. \nA lot of times this gets brought up in use of force cases where the question is whether a cop used excessive force. A lot of people get confused about QI and say the courts require that the exact situation has happened before and been addressed in court. Not really the case. The right to be free from excessive force (what the courts have said is considered a seizure under the 4th Amendment) has already been clearly established. \nQI is also often confused for indemnity. Indemnity or indemnification is separate and protects cops or other \u201ccolor of law actors\u201d from being held personally liable. That means if you sue a cop for something and are awarded money, that money is not paid by the cop directly. It\u2019s usually paid by an insurance company that the police department pays for a policy to cover them. Like doctors who have to have malpractice insurance. If you sue a doctor, that money comes from their insurance company. \nThat\u2019s a super broad explanation, there is a lot more to it but hope that helps.", "text1": "\u00a0Qualified immunity\u00a0protects federal, state, and local government employees when they violate individuals\u2019 constitutional rights.

Yes, they do occasionally happen, but the vast majority of prosecutors will go their entire careers without ever having filed an appeal.  In the exceedingly rare occasion when a prosecutor does file an appeal, its typically a once in a lifetime kind of deal.\n1) As far as sentencing goes, they can only appeal a sentence in which there is some obvious legal error.  This would be a case in which a sentence deviates from some sort of mandatory sentence - IE, the sentence is below a mandatory minimum sentence or falls outside of mandatory sentencing guidelines.  Prosecutors cannot appeal a sentence simply because they don't like it.\n2) Prosecutors cannot appeal a jury verdict.\n3) Prosecutors cannot appeal a judge's dismissal unless that dismissal was due to a misapplication of the relevant law.  This would be something like the judge ruling that the law in question was unconstitutional or ruling that the indictment against the defendant didn't state a cause of action when it did.  \n4) Prosecutors can appeal certain pre-trial procedural issues, such as the admissibility of evidence.  This has to happen before the trial actually starts.  Once the trial starts the prosecution has effectively waived any right it may have had to appeal pre-trial rulings.  \nAgain, a prosecution appeal of a pre-trial ruling is *much* rarer than it sounds.  Defendants don't have any obligation to the court and typically appeal any appealable issue, even if they don't have a good faith basis for the appeal.  Prosecutors *do* have obligations to the court and cannot appeal a pre-trial ruling unless they have a strong, good faith basis for believing that the ruling was in error and that the ruling *will* have effect the outcome of the trial.  \nIn other words, for a prosecutor to challenge a pre-trial ruling the judge had to get it really, incredibly wrong *and* it had to be concerning a major issue in the case, such as if a key witness would be allowed to testify.", "text1": " Federal prosecutors can appeal some decisions to the U.S. Supreme Court, in accordance with the court\u2019s appellate rules.

So if your local 1960's pet shop was selling kittens, once those kittens got too old to sell they would be shipped off to a medical lab.  The Animal Welfare Act was designed to stop that.\nAll the act does is to prohibit that practice and to establish a regulatory framework under which medical labs can be inspected to ensure that they're not using old pet animals for experimentation.  It only covers animals that were widely being sold as pets in the 1960's - most animals are not covered by it.\nIts not unusual for things like that to be regulated at the state level in the US.

{"prefix": "Q: What is with the abortion-banning law currently happening in Texas?\nA:", "gold": "Going to get removed, but here is your answer.\nThey didn't ban them. They just made the restrictions so tight that they are effectively banned. The SCOTUS allowed reasonable restrictions on abortions in Casey, and many states have been pushing the limit on what is 'reasonable.'\nThe Texas legislature passed the most restrictive bill in recent memory. Abortions after 6 weeks are basically forbidden, which means that almost all women will be too far along for an abortion by the time they realize they are pregnant.\nHistorically, the SCOTUS has struck down laws like this that were overly restrictive, but in this case (in a 5-4 decision) the decided reject an emergency injunction - meaning the law is in effect until the larger case is heard.\nSo, for now, abortions are banned in Texas in every way that matters.", "text1": " The most obvious answer is the \u201cnot real\u201d argument, which is that the very act of making an unconstitutional law somehow allows it to become constitutional; since the law bans abortions even in the case of rape and incest, it is obviously unconstitutional; but the law requires a woman seeking an abortion to get the permission of the would-be father of the child, even in the case of rape and incest, and therefore it is \u201cconstitutional\u201d.\u00a0 Other, related arguments, are that the law serves to protect women\u2019s health; that it does not ban abortion in cases of rape and incest, because an independent clause in the law exempts abortions performed in cases of rape or incest; that the law, which apparently will result in a substantial number of women dying from botched, illegal abortions, \u201cdoesn\u2019t let women die\u201d.\nWhile the above have all been given as arguments by pro-life Republicans, the most important element to understanding the law is the role of the anti-abortion movement in Republican political strategy.\u00a0 The Republicans have an extremely complicated and esoteric theory about the relationship between family, law, and the economy.\u00a0 It has been over-simplified to its underlying principle: that to be an authentic American, one must have a family.\u00a0 The longer and more complicated a family one has, the more authentic an American one is.\u00a0 Therefore, abortion threatens the soul of the nation.", "text2": " The bill bans abortions after 7 weeks, but there are two important things to know before coming to a final conclusion.\nFirst off, the bill does not hold doctors liable for these violations. Instead, it gives private citizens the power to sue any doctors who provide an abortion after the cutoff point. While Texas and a small number of other states including Mississippi and Louisiana ban abortion after 7 weeks, and 15 weeks, none are using citizens as \u201cagents of the government.\u201d\nSecondly, this law is specifically in response to the Supreme Court cases, which could undo 45 years of precedent of Roe v Wade. The bill was filed immediately after Justice Ginsberg died, knowing that it could be overturned as the courts are split on the issue. The Texas Senate cleared this legislation with just one Democrat in support of the measure. While some may be happy to see a law pass, this law could be another signal of an upcoming Supreme Court case against abortion nationwide. The court may be divided right down the line.\nThere are many issues and questions we have to answer. Is this law appropriate? How much should the government control and interfere in the life of the people? Shouldn't the power of the government come under the people? Or should the government rule? Should this law be challenged in the Supreme Court?\u00a0\nI think I am of the opinion that the government is running and has been running out of control. The people should have the power in the first place.", "text3": "Please provide a rephrased version of the sentence. Before making a final decision, it is important to understand two key points about the bill that prohibits abortions after 7 weeks. To start with, doctors are not held responsible for these violations under the bill. Private citizens are given the authority to take legal action against doctors who perform abortions after the specified time limit. Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana have laws banning abortion after 7 and 15 weeks, but they do not involve citizens in enforcing these laws. Additionally, this legislation is a direct reaction to potential Supreme Court decisions that may overturn decades of established legal precedent set by Roe v Wade. The bill was introduced right after Justice Ginsberg's death, anticipating the possibility of it being overturned due to the divided opinions in the courts. The bill in question was approved by the Texas Senate with minimal support from Democrats. Some individuals may view the passing of this law as a positive development, but it could also indicate a potential Supreme Court challenge to abortion rights on a national scale. The court could be evenly split. We have numerous concerns and inquiries to address. Does this legislation align with ethical standards? What level of government involvement in people's lives is appropriate? Shouldn't the authority of the government be in the hands of the citizens? Should the government have authority? Is it appropriate to question this law in the Supreme Court? I believe that the government is currently operating unchecked and has been for some time.

More and more, it has been written into contracts that players and teams agree to behave. Even agents understand that players need to control their tempers or they\u2019ll find it much harder to negotiate big contracts.

It's hard to explain in a short reddit comment, but overcrowding can easily lead to a [crowd crush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_collapses_and_crushes), where a large group of people begins to behave like a singular fluid mass and it becomes impossible for any individual to move normally. This commonly results in tramplings and suffocations, which is what killed all those people at Astroworld. \nScott also encourages his audiences to \"rage,\" which contributes to a culture of ignoring serious issues. At Astroworld, he continued to encourage this behavior even when an ambulance was making its way through the crowd. Although, in his defense, ambulances are not entirely uncommon at large events and he probably didn't fully understand what was happening.\nMy understanding is that this is not the first time something like this has happened at a Travis Scott concert, it's just the most severe incident, and that many other artists are much more conscientious about monitoring the crowds at their shows.

The prosecutor may, for example, find the defendant\u2019s testimony to be more credible than the defendant\u2019s witnesses.

Therefore, a \u201cno contest\u201d plea is not an admission of guilt, but is treated the same as a guilty plea for purposes of sentencing.\nQ: How is a trial different from a hearing?\nA: A trial involves witnesses testifying before a jury who determine whether the government has met its burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt. At the trial, witnesses are not limited to the events that occurred on the date of the alleged crime. At trial, the defense has the opportunity to present evidence, and may present witnesses.", "text2": " It's pretty much a \"no-duh, Captain\", kind of answer: a guilty plea takes much less work for prosecutors and judges.

They operate outside the U.S.", "text1": " I shall start by explaining the similarities then the differences because this is the question and also most people would tend to start a piece of work this way. Both the Police and the FBI are part of the same governing body. The FBI in particular has a department that is a part of the national police structure called the Federal Police Service. The Federal Police Service is an operational force that provides support to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies in areas such as: crime scene management, firearms regulation, vehicle registration, explosives licensing, security screening, guarding sensitive national installations and the supervision and control of public demonstrations and so on. Within the national police structure the FBI is made up of three major divisions, the first being the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). They investigate crimes such as murder, fraud, extortion and drug trafficking; they also provide specialist advice and training in areas such as photography, fingerprints and fingerprinting, forensic, controlled drugs, firearms, major crime investigations, management, building searches, reconstruction of crime scenes, and media presentations. Secondly, the Organised Crime Division (OCD), which investigates offences involving organised crime and drug trafficking, and thirdly the Support Division (SPD) which provides specialist and technical support to investigators by managing and maintaining the physical evidence control system and safe, fingerprint recognition systems, and specialist mobile search and investigation teams. These teams deal with: major crimes involving firearms, motor vehicle theft, arson, sexual offences, child abuse and white-collar crime.", "text2": " I am not sure what similarity you are looking for, but there are many.

The author could make some spectacle at the tea party to distract you from the time. They've hidden the fact that the narrator must have done something in that 20 mins in the story without drawing your attention. Once you know what happens in the 20 mins,  that 20 mins will stick out like a sore thumb because now you know to look for it.\nA bad plot twist just comes out from nowhere and is a deus ex machina.", "text1": " Plot twists are what we use in narrative fiction to create dramatic tension and surprise.\n\u201cSurprise\u201d can come from two directions: Something the reader didn't know, or something the reader did know. Both can create a temporary emotional charge that draws the reader in. But surprise is the shock value, not the point. Plot twists exist to accomplish a goal in the story: To ratchet up the tension, to make a dramatic change, to get the characters out of a tight spot, to reveal a plot point, to establish some truth about the characters.\nAuthors can hide things from us in two ways. The most important method is to choose an effective hiding place, or a \u201cthreat point\u201d (a term I believe I learned from Nathan Bransford).\nIf you have a character that we assume is dead, but then reveal at the end that they\u2019re actually alive, you have created a perfect hiding place. We know this character is dead, and so that means we will look to see if they\u2019re dead. So they\u2019re in the perfect hiding place.\nSimilarly, if we think the heroine is having a mundane illness (something like chicken pox), but then she turns out to have the black plague, then that illness is hiding right out in the open. Since we don\u2019t suspect anything, we won\u2019t be looking for anything. So it's a perfect hiding place. That's the kind of hiding place we want.\nThere are all kinds of hiding places.", "text2": " I think many of us think we all know where the story was going and just before that moment, it suddenly veers in another unpredictable - sometimes far-fetched direction.

When there is nothing and you are just taken in by surprise by a far-fetched plot twist (that makes people leave the movie), you can feel it's not good story-telling on the part of the author. On the other hand, in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for example the plot twist about the money stashing relative is so well orchestrated and timed that it made me jump with surprise in spite of myself.

{"prefix": "Q: Who is Kyle Rittenhouse and why is his trial a big thing?\nA:", "gold": "Answer:\nKeep in mind this is coming from someone without any formal legal background. This is a write up with facts from the trial. \nRittenhouse is a 17-year-old dude from Illinois. I forget what city, but it is quite close to the IL-WI border. He's worked in Kenosha, he has family and friends who live in Kenosha. I believe he said he gave money to an older friend of his (Dominic Black) to buy an AR rifle. This firearm never left the state of Wisconsin and was only ever possessed by Rittenhouse when Black was also present. On the 25th, Rittenhouse was given the rifle by Black.\nRittenhouse was not an EMT, however was an EMT cadet with his local fire department and had some basic EMT and medical training. He and several friends went to Kenosha essentially to look after the community after seeing the destruction the night before due to riots occurring because of the Jacob Blake shooting. An owner of a used car lot called Car Source asked for protection (from people he knew and ultimately became Rittenhouse and his friends) of his business after seeing every car burned at another location. They agreed and mostly remained around this location.\nDuring the day, Rittenhouse got a sling for his rifle so it was attached to his body. This made it so he would not have to set the rifle down or be able to be stolen while he gave someone medical attention or handled a fire extinguisher. Later, a police line essentially moved them from the Car Source. During the night, Rittenhouse and his accomplices put out dumpster fires and gave medical attention to some people with minor injuries.\nA man, Rosenbaum, was seen being very aggressive towards Rittenhouse and his accomplices. Rosenbaum even made threats at Rittenhouse twice. One time where he said something close to \"if I catch you alone I'll kill you.\" He also yelled (as a white man) \"shoot me n\u2022\u2022\u2022a! shoot me n\u2022\u2022\u2022a!\" At other similarly armed men. Rosenbaum also becomes angry and aggressive when a dumpster fire is put out. Later, Rittenhouse believes he is walking with a friend, but loses him, making him alone.\nThe first shots: Rittenhouse, alone, finds himself being chased by Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum yells \"fuck you!\" at him and throws what I believe is an empty plastic bag in his direction. A man nearby shoots 2 rounds into the air. Rittenhouse reacts, unsure where they came from, he turns towards Rosenbaum, who is charging Rittenhouse, and Rittenhouse points his rifle at Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum does not stop. Rittenhouse runs again, to find himself somewhat cornered because of some parked cars and other protestors. Rittenhouse stops when cornered and turns around, once turned around, Rosenbaum lunges at Rittenhouse, grabbing for his rifle. Rittenhouse fires 4 rounds very quickly one after another. These rounds killed Rosenbaum. You may hear that Rosenbaum was shot in the back. Although true, this is misleading. This round goes into his back entering his body closer to his head and the bullet goes down his body as if he was shot from above. This shot goes into his back this way because Rosenbaum is horizontal as he lunges at Rittenhouse and his body is lower than the rifle when this bullet is shot. I hope that makes sense. Rittenhouse stays for a brief second, and calls his friend, Black, for a few seconds to tell him he shot someone because he had to. His call was cut short when a mob begin to chase him while threatening him and throwing things at him. Of course, Rittenhouse runs away. Rittenhouse begins running towards the police line to turn himself in.\nAfter running down the street followed by a mob of angry, aggressive, and threatening demonstrators, Rittenhouse trips and falls due to being lightheaded from a combination of running and being struck in the head by a concrete rock. When having fallen down, an unknown man kicks Rittenhouse in the face. Rittenhouse fires 2 shots at him as he is being kicked, both miss, this man runs away.\nVery shortly after, Rittenhouse is struck in the back of the neck/upper back with a skateboard by a man named Huber. Huber sort of runs over Rittenhouse's prone body after this, while also grabbing for Rittenhouse's rifle. Rittenhouse fires a round into his chest as Huber is on top of him, proving fatal for Huber.\nSimultaneously, another man, Grosskreutz is running after Rittenhouse as well. Grosskreutz also has an illegally possessed handgun in his hand. Grosskreutz stops advancing towards Rittenhouse (once he is around 3-4 feet away) because of Rittenhouse's shot at Huber. This causes Grosskreutz to stop and put his hands up, still keeping his handgun in his hand. Rittenhouse sees him quickly after shooting Huber and points his rifle at Grosskreutz, which is also why Grosskreutz put his hands up. However, I believe (based on video) that since Grosskreutz stops and puts his hands up, Rittenhouse begins to slightly lower his rifle. Grosskreutz testified that Rittenhosue \"reracked\" (also known as rechambering) the rifle at this time. Rittenhouse disputed this in court and I believe video evidence shows that this never happened. Once Rittenhouse sort of slightly lowers his rifle, Grosskreutz (to his own admission and testimony) lunges at Rittenhouse and points his handgun at Rittenhouse's head. Rittenhouse is quick enough to shoot Grosskreutz before Grosskreutz is able to advance any further. He hits Grosskreutz's bicep, damaging his arm severely. Grosskreutz runs away seeking medical attention and lives to tell the story. For this shooting, I want to emphasize (because this is pretty key) that Grosskreutz admitted in his testimony that Rittenhouse did not shoot him until he lunged at Rittenhouse, dropped his arms, and pointed his handgun at Rittenhouse.\nRittenhouse gets up and advances towards the police, putting his hands up when he approaches trying to turn himself in. The officer (who is in his squad car) who is being approached by Rittenhouse, orders Rittenhouse to stay back, pepper sprays Rittenhouse, and tells Rittenhouse to go home. Rittenhouse goes home in Illinois where he explained to his mother what happened. Rittenhouse goes to his local police station to turn himself in, driven by his mother. He arrives at the police station less than an hour after the shooting.\nThe big thing part comes in protecting self defense as this case could cause precedent.", "text1": " Kyle Rittenhouse is a young man from Antioch, Illinois (near Chicago) who is on trial for killing two people and injuring one other during the protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin last year.

Some think that he was a vigilante or even a murderer. For those who support him, it\u2019s an issue of self-defense and using deadly force when you feel your life is in danger. Those who don\u2019t think Rittenhouse should have killed anyone, point to the fact that he broke the law. Wisconsin law states that if you\u2019re under 18 you cannot carry a gun if you\u2019re not in military or law enforcement. That\u2019s the law Rittenhouse broke.

You could get a sense that the tide was changing, but by the end of the 1960s, the tide had changed in the opposite direction. The War on Drugs was declared by President Richard Nixon and marijuana prohibition had officially become the law of the land.

Some argue that requesting identification could be seen as admitting guilt or involvement in a crime. In Canada, individuals must be provided with a written warning or informed of their rights when questioned by a peace officer, along with full identification as a police officer. Not informing someone properly could result in their statement being used against them later, even if they were a peace officer who simply forgot. Both parties are required to show identification.

David Schmiedicke of Holland said that forfeiture is a tool the police department used on occasion. He is a member of the forfeiture unit of the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office.\nOttawa County Sheriff's Deputy Nick Grooters, who is assigned to the forfeiture unit, said the Sheriff's Office seized more than $25,000 from one person who pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine, under state guidelines.\nGrooters said the money was forfeited through the victim's forfeiture fund, which allows victims of a crime to collect money from the criminal activity.\nThe victim's forfeiture fund is not forfeited automatically if a plea deal is reached, Schmiedicke said.

Rather than outright banning abortions after six weeks, the Texas law just allows any Texas resident with \"no vested interest\" to sue a doctor or clinic who aids with an abortion after the six-week link. So it's not actually the government of the State that's preventing the abortion occurring, it's just random \"concerned citizens\" who are doing that, and thus Roe vs Wade does not apply. This is obviously arrant sophistry and is undergoing challenge in the courts, AFAIK, but no outcome as yet.", "text1": " The structure is like this: by leaving the determination to the individual, with the Texas Legislature funding the private parties to do the legal work and bear the financial risk of pursuing the claims against abortionists who do not follow the law.

If the Legislature or the funders run out of money to pay for all the cases, new legislation can be passed to appropriate more funds.

If the federal appeals court here in the Fifth Circuit reinstates the Texas law or if the Supreme Court chooses not to block it, it's likely to end the threat of legal action under the Constitution's equal protections clause.

{"prefix": "Q: Why so many people say \"Defund the police\"?\nA:", "gold": "It's a call for reallocating money spent on police to other agencies that could deal with the problems. It varies to different degrees on how to \"defund\" them to from reducing funding to completely abolishing police forces.\nIt's because 9/10 calls for police are non-violent encounters and a police officer's skillset are not often in sync with many of the social interactions that they deal with. A lot of the times it asks for them to shift to funding of social services to improve to reduce the need for police in general, such as helping mental health and homelessness.", "text1": " Because they are morons, they think police act like occupying forces. They haven't watched the movies about World War II.\nDefunding the police means reallocating money away from police departments, which have massive budgets, and towards community programs that reduce crime and violence. If someone was advocating to abolish the police and take away all of their funding, that would be a different story. However, neither defunding nor abolishing the police is what the movement is advocating for.\nQ: Is it ethical for somebody to be living off the tax dollars of others?\nA: No, it is not ethical for the individual to be living off the tax dollars of others. It is ethical, in a civilized society, to have taxes and policies in place to allow the disadvantaged a hand up. If you want to see the difference, look at U.S. Education. If you look at education in the U.S. in a very small timeline, you will see that funding, infrastructure, and support is used by the more advantaged to create their own advantage and very little is used to support the disadvantaged.\nQ: Why do you keep raising my taxes?\nA: Because you keep wanting government to do more things that you refuse to pay for yourself. The fewer taxes you pay, the less the government can do for you. Or, in other words, you can decide what things you want to pay for yourself, the better the country will be able to be for everyone.", "text2": " It's not the police we should defund -- it's abusive prosecutors.\nIn the last few months, we\u2019ve witnessed the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement and, in response to it, many people across America have been calling on police to be \u201cdefunded\u201d. I recently had an interesting conversation about this, with a close acquaintance named Lindsay. She called herself a libertarian, and we had met a lot of times at libertarian functions and on social media.\nIn the earlier hours of the evening (before drinking), we were in an Uber ride to the airport. During our conversation I took note that she had an interesting perspective.

This is because they will be responsible to serve the full term of service (length of time the draft lasts, usually two years, with the option to stay in for another six).\nBeing selected for Officer Candidate School or joining the JAG or JROTC programs can also qualify a person for a deferment.

It is important to have a common basis of knowledge about what the law is so that all people know what to expect when they are under the law. It would also be very unfair if some people had different rulings for the same crime. Having precedent helps a community feel safer because they know what to expect if they are in a situation that requires the justice system. For example, a person who was given 10 years for murder and is released on parole after 5 years would not be as likely to re-offend if he or she knew that the judge could have given a life sentence. Precedent is important because it allows people to know the rules of their community without having to re-learn them over and over again.\n  1. What is a precedent and how is it important in our system of government? It is important because precedent is used to determine an appropriate course of action for a situation that is similar to one that the government has already encountered. For example, a number of decisions in the United States Supreme Court decisions have established the precedent that it is unconstitutional for the government to impose a tax for what is essentially a license to exercise a Constitutional right (e.g., freedom of speech, bearing arms, etc.).", "text2": " Precedent is a fundamental aspect of the justice and British justice in particular due to the way in\u00a0which the common-law evolved. The common-law was based on precedent, with judges forming the rules by relying on earlier cases, the first rule of precedent, whether a case has been decided before, makes the outcome of current and futre cases, more predictable, this follows the principle to each their owm as it prevents the same rules applied to different groups of individuals or as is sometimes said, a rich person and a poor person.\u00a0 By looking back to previous cases, the principle of the precedent of stare decisis, allows judges to follow the previous decision made on the issue to be decided, the principle is made stronger when they are bound by precedent, and one particularly important reason for this being, consistency of outcomes of legal proceedings, following a case through the justice process is more predictable, this also prevents the same legal action being taken multiple times against the same individual, or the same organisation.\u00a0 Often, the decision made on the previous case would also represent the decision reached by parliament if the same case was decided under statute law. Following precedent avoids parties having to go to parliament for every legal dispute.", "text3": "Precedent is crucial in British justice because of the development of common law.

Attempting to control citizens having children is highly problematic, difficult, and has a long track record of ending badly.\nSo, that leaves immigration as the only knob that governments can control.  Immigrants often tend to be younger than the average citizen, and if they can move into the country and then have children it can be doubly beneficial in increasing the young population of a country.\nImmigrants also might be skilled, and the country they immigrate to gets the benefit of those skills while having paid none of the costs to educate the immigrant.  Another possibility for advantage.\nOn the flip side, some immigrants are refugees from disastrous failed states which have not prepared them with valuable skills.

And yet, almost as if to remind us that the sovereignty of nations is tenuous, and at times fickle, naturalization laws come and go, change and shift, over time. As an example, think back to the Naturalization Act of 1790, which restricted naturalization to free white persons only. Or to the Hart-Celler Act of 1965, which by ending the discriminatory quota system ended decades of legislation rooted in the fiction that ethnic and racial minorities should be excluded from naturalization. From one side of history to the other, laws governing who qualifies as a citizen of the United States have shifted. The same, in fact, is true of the naturalization laws of many other countries.

Because the EU sees itself as part of the same community, though it varies, being a citizen of one EU nation grants you more or less rights and privileges on the other EU member nations. Outside the EU, the lines get blurred a bit. American and Australian citizenships are slightly easier to gain and a bit easier to lose than some other countries. The US and Australia allow for people born outside of the country to their respective citizens if the child is born to parents serving in the military or working for a US government agency abroad, or if the child is born to parents abroad under certain conditions.

Are there rules and what is the point of this change? This article will answer these questions for you.\nWhat is 'unlimited time off'?\n'Unlimited time off' is a term the Commission uses to describe a range of parental, family, other or special leave schemes. These schemes have existed for many years and include leave taken by, for example, parents to care for children under the age of 18 or leave for people caring for relatives or adults with disabilities. A Commission employee can take this kind of leave without having to give any reason. They do not have to give any notice either. They can also take it from time to time rather than all at once. The Commission supports its staff members who need time off to care for their families or for other reasons by giving them the possibility to use this leave. There is no limit on the number of days of 'unlimited time off' that you can take.\n\"Unlimited time off\" means that you can take time off without asking for permission. You can take time off at short notice without giving a reason. You also have the option to take 'unlimited time off' in smaller chunks.", "text2": " The point of offering our employees unlimited time off is to give them time to take care of their personal health.

What were your challenges, and your successes? What were the cultural results?\nA: The decision to test out the unlimited time off was one that was important to everyone in the company. We were one of the first internet service providers in the city and we were built on the idea that our employees were our most valuable resource and would drive our success because of the quality of their work. We were passionate about making an environment where people could bring their best selves to work and to be able and willing to work as hard as we could to grow and succeed. If we needed everyone on every project to keep moving fast and making deadlines we needed a standard of personal accountability from our employees. We needed a high degree of consistency of work time so we had to agree on how we all measured when work time ended, even if there might have been some additional time working after hours. We also agreed that not every day was going to be 100%.", "text3": "We provide our employees with unlimited time off to allow them to prioritize their personal health.

The first thing to know about both crimes is that there is no requirement that the person killed be intentionally killed by the defendant, unlike first-degree murder. In other words, in order to be guilty of first-degree murder in Texas, the State would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to kill the person. That is not the case with second-degree murder. As for second-degree murder, there is no requirement that the defendant intended to kill. As long as the death occurs, the State has to prove only that the defendant committed an act that was criminally negligent or reckless. A reckless act is when a person\u2019s action is a dangerous disregard for human life that resulted in someone being killed.\nIf you think about the phrase \u201creckless disregard,\u201d you can see that it is broad. It is also subjective. That is, how dangerous would you think that a defendant\u2019s action was to result in a death? Some people would not consider an action dangerous at all. How can a state determine that one person would consider the action reckless while another person would not? As you can see, recklessness is very subjective and will therefore be difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Recklessness can be proven by the defendant\u2019s past history.

How can a jury determine guilt beyond reasonable doubt? When does it fall into my hands to decide my fate as opposed to the judge?

Although it can be argued the jury is nothing but the judge\u2019s tool for effectuating its judgment, the jury, in fact, possesses an important element of judicial independence. The verdict belongs to the jury, and a judge is not allowed to dictate the jury\u2019s findings. The judge is allowed, and required to assist the jury in its determination of guilt or innocence, and to correct the jury if the jury improperly interferes or applies the law.", "text3": "A primary duty of a skilled defense attorney is to question the evidence presented by the government regarding the details of the supposed crime.

This is usually used in plea bargaining to receive a sentence for a lesser charge, while still maintaining the assertion of innocence.  It's a hail Mary type of plea, usually, to avoid a case going to trial and likely being lost.", "text1": " Alford pleas were made famous in the 1997 movie \u201cPrimal Fear\u201d starring Richard Gere. Gere played an attorney who helps a sociopathic killer (Edward Norton) get off by going the Alford route, whereby the defendant says he is guilty while maintaining his innocence. The doctrine was developed in the 1976 United States Supreme Court case of North Carolina v. Alford.\nAn Alford plea is used when there is insufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but the defendant, after consultation with his attorney, still wants to resolve his case. This occurs most often in the context of a negotiated plea, which is an agreement between the defense attorney and the prosecutor as to the charge or charges to be filed and the punishment to be recommended. In an Alford plea, the defendant pleads guilty to one or more charges and the prosecutor agrees to drop other charges. The Alford plea is a way to save face for the defendant who wants to keep his or her record clean but does not believe he is guilty of all charges.\nIn the context of a trial, an Alford plea is more controversial. The Supreme Court has determined that a defendant has the right to plead guilty while maintaining his innocence. But the court has also determined that the defendant must have actually entered into the plea. Judges often refer to this as a knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea.", "text2": " Plea agreements offer defendants several benefits: the certainty and finality of sentencing, the ability to commit a crime without making a positive confession (necessary for a conviction), and, perhaps most significantly, the ability to withdraw the plea if the judge or the court of appeals finds the charge or the terms unreasonable. The last benefit permits no-cost trials, for example. If a court finds the charge unreasonable, a criminal defendant may withdraw the plea in most states and proceed with a trial. If the court finds the terms unreasonable, the criminal defendant may withdraw the plea in most states and proceed on the old charge.1 In our complex and messy system, plea bargaining provides many benefits to defendants, and a balanced system should offer defendants a path toward a resolution in reasonable charges that are reasonable terms.\n1 See, e.g., 404 Pa.Code \u00a7 303(d); Ark.

{"prefix": "Q: Whys was the guillotine method of execution considered so bad compared to electrocution, firing squad, gas chamber, lethal injection or hanging (and stoning). To me it seems so effective and instant that you would feel much at all, unlike the other methods that we still use.\nA:", "gold": "The guillotine is actually a quite modern and humane method of execution. It is quick and reliable. There were some reports from the executions during the French revolution indicating that the persons may have been alive after the executions but these have been debunked, although the myth is still propagated. The guillotine were in use up until 1977 when executions were abolished as a form of punishment in the countries using it. But it is still a method considered for executions even today.\nThe issue with the guillotine is that it is quite bloody which can be quite grusome for the people watching as well as those who have to clean up afterwards. But for the executed it is one of the best way to do it. Other countries used the long drop hanging method which is also instant but does not pierce the skin and therefore is less grusome. The problem with the long drop is that it requires more experience by the executioner as if the length of rope or the weight is wrong then it can result in strangling or decapitation. And today only a handful of people in the world have performed the long drop and none of them can be considered to be experienced.\nLethal injection is maybe the best way to perform executions although the process does take a lot longer then other method which can be considered as cruel in itself. Gas chambers is not as reliable and also does take a long time as well as dangerous for the executioners, it is very unpractical way of execution except for mass executions. Firing squads are a very practical easy way of execution by militaries as the tools are readily available. However it is quite unreliable and it is not uncommon for the executed to live for minutes after being shot, maybe only dying from a mercy shot to the head afterwards.", "text1": " I think it was actually considered relatively humane, and was thus especially useful for executions that had to be carried out in public and in the full view of the populace, as in the French Revolution. It's main advantage was that it was rather clean, and rather efficient in delivering the blow. But of course, any method of killing is going to be pretty efficient in delivering the blow, and so no one method can be said to be better than the other. All methods are cruel, just as any method of causing suffering to an animal is cruel.", "text2": " It's not considered \"bad\". Hanging is far more barbaric, more cruel than beheading. The major complaints against the guillotine is all related to the way it became the subject of public entertainment. All three European revolutions that occurred before the Industrial Revolution used the guillotine in the same way, and more or less to the same end. The American Revolution was different from European revolutions past in that the people actually got together - not in an aristocrat's palace, but rather in the public squares of their respective colonized towns and villages, and actually did overthrow their monarch. The French Revolution was different in the sense that it, too, had some actual reforms for the people of France - reforms that, once in place, were going to be very difficult for a monarchy to come and overturn without all but killing their respective people, etc. The American Revolutionaries didn't do any such thing. That's why the French Revolution was different in the sense that it actually tried something different, and that something different didn't fail until Napoleon went against what the French people wanted.\nThose people in Paris were a part of the events they witnessed, even if, in some cases, many of them weren't really too active, or just weren't happy with the guillotine until a king had to be brought down. All that the guillotine meant was the end of the monarchy.", "text3": "It is not deemed as negative. Hanging is considered more brutal and inhumane compared to beheading. Criticism of the guillotine mainly revolves around its transformation into a form of public spectacle. The guillotine was utilized in a similar manner and with similar outcomes in all three European revolutions preceding the Industrial Revolution. The American Revolution stood out from previous European revolutions because the people gathered in public squares of their colonized towns and villages to overthrow their monarch. The French Revolution also implemented significant reforms for the people of France, making it challenging for a monarchy to reverse them without severe consequences. The American Revolutionaries did not engage in similar actions. The French Revolution stood out for attempting something new, which only failed when Napoleon disregarded the desires of the French people. The people in Paris were involved in the events they saw, even if some were not very active or supportive of the guillotine until a king was overthrown.

Unfortunately, this is not true. Most of the time, the real conflict is between true believers and the legal system.\nThere is a strong body of thought, as exemplified by Christian and Judaic law, which suggests that if someone is found guilty of an egregious sin, then there is no possibility of redemption or forgiveness. The law will not allow for it and there is no recourse to plead for mercy in that regard.\nThe problem here is that it takes into account only a single deed that took place over a span of time.

You can sue anyone, for any reason, at anytime.  Our system is built to allow the courts to settle these matters.  \nAs you note though, yes you need to have suffered some kind of damage to have the *standing* to bring a legitimate suit.  You can sue someone for anything but the court can throw it out if you lack the standing.  So on the surface, yeah I suspect that this law won't stand up because the people don't have standing to bring the suit.\nHowever, I am sure the argument will be made that they are bringing the suit in defense (well really vengeance) for the fetus which is not in a position to bring a suit.  This may still be a moot point since the fetus is not legally a person under the law and the court cannot possibly provide some sort of redress or payment to make this better.\nIn the end though...

The pre-existing norms in the US in particular are all about federalism and state prerogative. Roe v Wade wasn\u2019t a misapplication of federal power so much as it violated the norms of state prerogative, and Roe v Wade came out of the federal supreme court.\nAnd of particular importance here is the other set of norms in the US jurisprudence. The US court has long preferred to craft narrow, limited rulings, the Supreme Court of the US has long preferred to craft narrow, limited holdings \u2013 usually decisions which allow various interests and activities with regard to controversial subjects to go forward, and only to draw up injunctions against egregious or illicit violations of the normative social consensus in the particular issues.

The US Supreme Court typically issues narrow rulings that allow for various interests and activities related to controversial subjects to continue, only intervening in cases of serious violations of social norms.

{"prefix": "Q: Why was prohibition of alcohol part of the constitution when other things have been federally outlawed without an amendment?\nA:", "gold": "The Constitution grants Congress the power \u201cTo regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes\u201d.  But under the original interpretation of this clause, they couldn\u2019t restrict commerce inside of a single state.  \nThis is why both the abolition of slavery and the prohibition of alcohol were done via constitutional amendment. Congress simply didn\u2019t have the power to do so otherwise.\nThis changed with *Wickard v. Filburn*.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn\nThe basics of the case:\n>An Ohio farmer, Roscoe Filburn, was growing wheat to feed animals on his own farm. The US government had established limits on wheat production, based on the acreage owned by a farmer, to stabilize wheat prices and supplies. Filburn grew more than was permitted and so was ordered to pay a penalty. In response, he said that because his wheat was not sold, it could not be regulated as commerce, let alone \"interstate\" commerce\nThe Supreme Court disagreed.\n>The Court decided that Filburn's wheat-growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for animal feed on the open market, which is traded nationally, is thus interstate, and is therefore within the scope of the Commerce Clause. Although Filburn's relatively small amount of production of more wheat than he was allotted would not affect interstate commerce itself, the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers like Filburn would become substantial. Therefore the Court decided that the federal government could regulate Filburn's production.\nThis interpretation of the Commerce Clause granted Congress *way* more power to regulate the economy, since almost anything could be considered interstate commerce under the reasoning SCOTUS used in this case. \nThat reasoning is why Congress can, for example, criminalize the production and use of drugs like marijuana or heroin with legislation rather than requiring a constitutional amendment.\n*United States v. Lopez* somewhat curtailed this broad view of interstate commerce, but not much.  *Gonzales v. Raich* upheld the view of marijuana grown at home for personal use as being interstate commerce, for example.", "text1": " There were several Prohibition Amendments of the 18th amendment included in Article I.

Americans really did believe that alcohol caused crime and was a gateway to other evils, but over time alcohol was reduced to a taxation issue. I think that is why there was a need to amend the constitution to prohibit alcohol at the time. I also think that because alcohol is a widely used substance, it is one of the few issues that has been proven in a long run test to help people and society in general.\nI also think the constitution is so tightly held together with the Prohibition Amendment because there were so many Amendments to make.

{"prefix": "Q: Why are prison sentences stacked upon each other?\nA:", "gold": "You can serve time \u201cconcurrently\u201d or \u201cconsecutively\u201d for multiple convictions. Someone serving concurrent 2-year sentences for burglary and weapons possession should in theory be out of jail in two years.  Someone serving a consecutive sentence for the same thing would in theory be out in four years. \nNow what people don\u2019t know is that in some areas you get \u201ccredit\u201d for every hour you don\u2019t cause trouble in jail. So if you don\u2019t cause trouble for an hour, you get credit for an additional hour of jail time.  So in the previous concurrent example the convict would be out in just one year and in the consecutive example he would be out in two years. \nHow the sentences are handed down is often dictated by state sentencing guidelines. The judge has a series of checks that determine the length of sentence and how it is to be served. If there is a prior criminal past that pushes the sentencing one way and if there is no history then it pushes it the other way. Things like employment, family in the community, job, home ownership, etc. can also play a role in sentencing.  \nFor most serious crimes parole or early release is also possible if a percentage of the sentence has been served (I believe like 75-85%).   So after 8.5 years of a 10-year sentence someone could be eligible for early release.  In particularly heinous crimes, or frequent convictions, the sentences are designed to prevent early release by assigning more years to a sentence and making it a consecutive sentence rather than concurrent.  \nSo a child rapist who accidentally kills their victim might only have gotten convicted for second degree murder, or maybe even just manslaughter.  Those would have significantly fewer years of potential punishment than first degree murder.  So for the rape the guy might only get 5-years and for manslaughter he\u2019d get maybe 10-years. All total he could serve as little as just 5-years (remember he gets an hour of credit for every hour he serves with no trouble) and if the 5 and 10 year sentences are served concurrently then he would be out in no time. \nBy making the sentences consecutive he would serve as little as 7.5 years and as many as 15. \nBut a lot of it has to do with prior criminal history.", "text1": " Because life in prison is bad enough without there being anyone else around.\nQ: Why is there no military defense department?\nA: Because it would be impossible to defeat.\nQ: What is the main difference between Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking?\nA: Albert Einstein got a Nobel Prize for his life's work.

A student can be accused of plagiarism if he or she uses too much of another's words or ideas and fails to provide proper citation. It is always best to paraphrase and summarize a source, and to directly quote it in moderation.\nReferencing materials gives a reader the exact location of where you found the materials. In most fields, there is an accepted format for citing materials and it is important to know the difference between the formats. This ensures proper crediting of the original author.\nSome researchers prefer to use plagiarism checkers such as Turnitin.com, iThenticate, DupliChecker, and Copyleaks to ensure they aren\u2019t using others\u2019 work.

There is a minimum mandatory sentence for a drug offense of five years, I believe. So if somebody's caught with five pounds of marijuana, they have to do five years in prison. So you get cases like that. Cases with mandatory minimums get kicked up to the feds. Sometimes it's a state case. The feds get involved.

Maybe it's somebody the feds are really hot after, or if the police chief or the district attorney are getting a lot of heat to convict somebody, maybe that person gets indicted in federal court.

{"prefix": "Q: Why Does It Take So Long Between a Prisoner Getting Sentenced to Death and Being Executed?\nA:", "gold": "It depends on the state.  \nCalifornia, for example, will sentence people to death, but the governor has to actually order the execution to be carried out and none have in 15 years.  So when you get sentenced to death in California you go to death row, but never actually get executed because the governor never orders that to happen.\nIn other states its typically more of an issue of the types of appeals afforded to death penalty cases.  In a non-death penalty case you cannot typically introduce new evidence on appeal.  The only thing your appeal can concern is some error that occurred at trial.  You also only get one (1) appeal.  After that you can file something called a \"habeas motion\" but courts aren't obligated to hear those and most just shove them in a drawer and forget about them.  However, most states allow death penalty cases to appeal on the basis of new evidence.\nWhat this means is that if you claim to have any sort of new evidence that's relevant to your case, a court will stay your execution while it evaluates whatever it is that you've produced.  Getting a decision on that new evidence often takes a year or two, during which time you can't be executed.  The burden for what qualifies as new evidence is non-existent.  *Anything* that you purport to prove your innocence counts.  \nSomeone who wasn't born at the time of the murder but now claims they saw someone else do it?  That's new evidence.  DNA evidence that shows a mere 99.99999% chance that you committed the crime?  There's a .00001% chance that the DNA came from someone else so that's new evidence that the court *has* to consider before you can be executed.  Once they've denied your appeal, you get to keep appealing so long as you can continue to produce new evidence.\nThere are plenty of organizations that go out and actively find new witnesses or pay for additional evidence testing to stall out death penalty cases, so its often possible to stall out an execution until your right to appeal on the basis of new evidence is cut off.  *Typically* most states cut you off after either 5 or 10 years from the date of your conviction, so that's the point at which whatever administrative process is necessary to execute you begins moving foward.  \nSome states have shorter or longer cut offs, but typically when you see death row inmates dying of natural causes its because you're either in a California situation, where the death penalty exists in name only, or in a state that has a really long cut off for death row inmates being able to appeal their conviction on the basis of new evidence.", "text1": " There is a process that must be followed in carrying out the sentence of death, and there is a list of hurdles a prisoner must clear before reaching that goal.

The grounds for appeal, by either the defense or prosecution, have expired and the prisoner has had their rights as an individual to appeal and have the case reviewed by the courts.\nWhen the prisoner is finally executed, their case is effectively closed.

If you're arguing something to humiliate the other person, that's bad faith. If you're arguing to stroke your ego, that's bad faith. If you're arguing to \"win\" some imaginary battle and aren't intending to give your opponent a fair shake, that's bad faith. If you intentionally misrepresent your evidence, lie, cheat, divert the discussion away from areas that you don't have the upper hand, that's bad faith.\nQuestions asked in bad faith work in the same way. Generally one asks a question because they'd like to know the answer, or rhetorically they ask them as a way to highlight some point or argument and get those present to view the discussion in a different light.

One of the most famous prosecutions in the early days of the Justice Department's fight against organized crime was the conviction of Al Capone on charges of tax evasion. While some prosecutors wanted to bring Capone to justice on charges of violent crimes, such as murder and racketeering, Capone had bribed and intimidated witnesses to prevent them from testifying, and no jury could be persuaded that he was guilty.\nProsecutors finally brought charges of income tax evasion against Capone, in part, because he had neglected to file an income tax return for 1929. There was very little financial information to support a conviction on income tax evasion, so prosecutors obtained records showing that Capone had made thousands of dollars of cash payments to various individuals. Prosecutors then proved that Capone made the payments to keep crime victims from testifying against him in court. Capone was convicted and sentenced to prison.\nThe conviction was a turning point in organized crime prosecution. Because of Capone's high profile, his conviction sent a signal to organized crime figures that they could not bribe and intimidate witnesses in criminal trials.

This is called premeditation.  It means that you intend to kill them - you are trying to kill them.  It\u2019s complete, evil, cold blooded murder.\n2nd-degree murder = when you intentionally kill someone without premeditation.   So, you don\u2019t actually have that thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill this person,\u201d but you still shoot them in the face.   \n3rd-degree murder is when your actions guarantee the death of a person, but you did not necessarily intend death to occur.

Third degree murder is defined as killing someone with reckless indifference to human life.\nQ: How is involuntary manslaughter different than 3rd degree murder in Pennsylvania\nA: The difference between 3rd degree murder and involuntary manslaughter is that involuntary manslaughter requires you to be negligent.

For example, a person who kills someone during a reckless act such as driving under the influence or in a fight will be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\nQ: What is the difference between negligent manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter in Pennsylvania\nA: The difference between negligent manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter is that negligent manslaughter only requires you to be negligent.

The fact of the matter is that, no matter what my stance on the death penalty, executions that fail and the state fails to fix those failures because of internal feuds make me angry.\nI have, in the past, written about the case of the State of Florida v.

These social facilities \"allow\" these people to live in the social facilities, but, of course, they also want the social facilities to be free of drugs, violent crime, etc., etc. and have very little tolerance for things that they find unacceptable. Therefore, the social facilities do not like their residents to run wild in the cities, so they control access to the cities, often making it difficult for people living in these \"abandoned cities\" to get in.\nSo, \"abandonment\" does not mean that the people are actually out in the streets, looking for work or simply wandering about.

While it may be an asset to you, there are still some factors that may make it illiquid. Generally, the only reason an asset would be illiquid is because the value of that asset can only be determined by its specific purpose. The value of an illiquid asset may vary depending on who the buyer is. Illiquid assets are often used by businesses to build their financial strength. Businesses are often the owners of illiquid assets such as real estate and art. They have different reasons for why these types of assets are illiquid. For example, they might want to keep them in their possession for a particular purpose or to hold them until the market improves.\nQ: Why would you want an illiquid asset?\nA: The reason to hold on to an illiquid asset is because of its inherent value, or the fact that it could one day have a significant value if you sell it on the market.

When you get a notification they have probably just printed the shipping label and calculated a route for your package using the existing scheduled services. Typically you would have trucks doing pickups in the afternoon collecting all the packages from an area and driving them to the closest distribution center.

There were less truck drivers to deliver the stuff as well.", "text1": " It's the usual, supply and demand. During a brief, temporary period this past year, oil producing countries were producing far more oil than there was demand. So prices plunged. All oil producers (and gas companies too) get paid in relation to the price of their products. So once oil producers began to suffer losses on their products (during the drop in price) many of them have had to curtail their production. This has led to lower supply and correspondingly higher demand, which in turn has led to a rise in prices.\nQ: My home gas company has posted prices that are high compared to my neighbours, who live in an area that is somewhat farther away from the gas pump. Is this a reason to complain to the regulator?\nA: No. Gas companies are allowed to charge different prices to different customers depending on their individual circumstances. For example, one customer may be located very close to a gas supply that has very little gas in it, whereas another may be farther away from that same supply, but closer to another gas supply that has a much larger amount of gas in it.\nQ: Why does natural gas have to go through a compressor to be moved through a pipeline?\nA: Gas is compressible but it still takes a lot of energy to push it through a pipeline. Thus, it must be compressed. The greater the pressure, the greater the capacity of the pipeline.\nQ: What are the factors that influence the price of gas and electricity?", "text2": " The high demand for fossil energy has been followed by a high demand for crude oil, the best source for making gas and diesel. The more we use it, the harder it becomes to supply it.\nQ: What about the rising price of oil, and its effect on global fuel price? What does that ultimately mean for us, the ordinary people?\nA: I am only interested in the problem of rising oil prices. If petrol price goes up to $7 a barrel, I still want to know how to bring it down to $1 per barrel. That is a job we can all share, and together change course towards natural energy sources based on the unlimited sources of the Sun and wind, and enhanced co-operation between countries. Only by doing this can we move away from wars, violence and chemical pollution. If we start with Earth we shall be in more profound relationship to each other than if we start with money or war. Our interest in the essential foundations around the world brings about creative peace, and with it, cheap energy for all.\nQ: How can we and Earth Enterprises help?\nA. We can all get involved in getting alternatives, getting into solar powered transportation of one form or the other.

As demand increases, the supply becomes more challenging to meet. How does the increasing cost of oil impact the price of fuel worldwide? How does this affect regular individuals like us? A: My focus is solely on the issue of increasing oil costs. I am interested in finding ways to reduce the price of petrol even if it reaches $7 per barrel. We can all work together to shift towards renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, with increased collaboration between nations. This is the only way to transition away from conflicts, aggression, and environmental contamination. Beginning with a focus on the Earth will lead to stronger connections between people compared to starting with money or conflict. Our focus on fundamental global structures fosters innovative peace, resulting in affordable energy access for everyone. How can we collaborate with Earth Enterprises to address this issue?

One part is what causes banks to make money on lending when inflation is high, and another part is whether inflation actually reduces bank profits.\nA) Interest Margins: An obvious place to start is with the traditional notion that bank profits depend on the \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cmargin\u201d between the interest banks pay on deposits and the interest banks receive on loans. One idea in the 1980s was that inflation would shrink bank profits because of higher interest rates. However, the Federal Reserve never raised interest rates enough to create inflation above 10 percent (in the early 1980s) or even to keep up with inflation (during the 1970s). Bank profits therefore increased along with inflation. In the 1970s, bank profitability rose and fell with interest rates, and in the 1980s, it rose along with interest rates. Banks did not lose money when they lent at a higher rate than inflation.\nB) Capital Inflows: This question does not address whether a given bank loses or makes money on a loan. Rather, it concerns a bank\u2019s ability to make money. A bank profits when it is able to increase its capital (the sum of deposits, capital and reserves), and capital grows when interest on loans exceeds interest on deposits.", "text2": " The question may be somewhat unfair as it suggests inflation does not exist.\nBanks, like all other commercial entities are trying to buy something for less than they are trying to sell and that can be done without there being any inflation at any point. Also, a bank is not a consumer. If a bank is lending short term it's usually because it can loan it short term and therefore create it out of nothing. If the money is to be used for a longer period the bank has to find depositors who are prepared to accept the lower rate of return, or invest the money itself.\nBanks do not exist to maximise return, or minimise the risk of loss, but just to minimise the risk of loss and manage profitability in other ways.", "text3": "The question could be seen as unfair because it implies that inflation is not real. Banks, along with other businesses, aim to purchase goods for a lower price than they sell them for, regardless of inflation. Furthermore, banks do not function as consumers. Banks typically lend short term because they have the ability to create money out of thin air for those loans. To use the money for a longer period, the bank must either find depositors willing to accept a lower rate of return or invest the money itself.

This is because you are now creating a system of perpetual income streams. Since no other marketing or sales strategies outside of MLM or Internet marketing can really generate residual income this one factor alone should outweigh the initial investment and startup costs of an MLM business versus a normal one. But then if you are wondering why it is only one factor you would be correct. It is one of the main factors but it is not the only one.\nThe other main factor in the startup costs in MLM versus a normal business is that the costs are much lower. This is because you do not have to worry about the things a normal business is associated with like owning the building, hiring people, training people, having office space, paying salaries to the owners or employees etc. These are not things that you have to worry about because in most cases they do not exist.

But prices for certain goods normally do, and the increased prices for staple goods normally hurt the most because they\u2019re things people regularly need but have a harder time paying for (gas, food, etc.). Some industries get hit harder than others like tourism and recreation because people don\u2019t have extra money to spend to do things aside from the necessities to keep their household afloat.

There are many causes of this depression. The article below by Phillip Longman provides a balanced discussion of these causes, and also shows us that this crash has two causes, and not one. I will add some more comments to this article to explain why.\nAs I have explained before, one of the causes of the crash is population growth. Let us say that the boom of 2001-2008 is equivalent to a huge balloon (say, a beach ball) which is inflated to almost double its normal size. During this period, our growth of income was artificial because it was supported by artificial debt. This is what happens when we grow the population. We use natural resources, like oil, at a rate higher than normal, causing inflation (a shortage of resources and an excess of people). But since the growth in population is artificial (it is artificial debt and therefore artificial growth) this is not sustainable in the long run. Eventually we have a bust, such as in 2008, and the balloon deflates. During the inflation, a lot of wealth is created, but during the deflation, a lot of the debt (bubbles) burst and the wealth is destroyed. This is what we have seen since 2008. Our wealth is decreasing.

I almost understand it :')\nA:", "gold": "The formulas used by automated market makers (AMMs) vary but they all have one thing in common: to provide the liquidity that the markets use to make assets available to buy, liquidity providers give some of each asset in the trading pair to a liquidity pool. **But as soon as someone buys either asset, the liquidity provider has less of it.** (That is, the liquidity provider's claim to what's left in the pool is reduced on the side of what the buyer bought, while their claim to what's left on the other side is increased.) At first glance it may seem that the total value should remain the same, but it doesn't. \nAs an exaggerated example, let's say the trading pair is BERT and ERNIE, and at the moment you create the BERT-ERNIE liquidity pool, both BERT and ERNIE are valued in other markets at $5 each. Let's say you put 10 BERT and 10 ERNIE in the pool. You contributed $50 + $50 = $100 of value to the pool. \nThen I buy 1 ERNIE from the pool, paying 1 BERT for it. Now the pool has 9 ERNIE and 11 BERT. If you were to withdraw your liquidity now, would the 9 ERNIE and 11 BERT you'd receive be worth as much as the 10 ERNIE and 10 BERT you deposited? Clearly the market has more demand for ERNIE than it does for BERT (as evidenced by the trade), so maybe ERNIE is now worth $5.50 while BERT is now worth $4.50. The pool, and your claim to it, is worth 9\u00d7$5.50 + 11\u00d7$4.50, or $99. Your impermanent loss (or divergence loss) is $1.\nPeople call it \"impermanent loss\" because the lost value can come back if sentiment for that trading pair swings the other way.

The rewards will be in the same asset so they can be either staked again or withdrawn.\nSecondly there is impermanent loss which means that the asset you provide in the liquidity pool can become worth less when it becomes out of the pool balance when the price fluctuates. As you get LP tokens you are actually selling a specific percentage of your assets, that's why you can lose part of the yield over time.

The main subject of investigation is the mechanisms governing exploitation and the profitability of capital. Interest rates and rates of profit are not viewed as functions of general economic forces, but as the returns to owners of productive capital. Likewise, wages are the revenues of workers for their exploitation, and wages are not determined by marginal productivity but by the value of labor power. Among other things, Marxian economists emphasize the important role that economic institutions play in shaping the workings of the economy. For example, Marxian economists usually view the market system as a critical element that fosters exploitation. Critics of Marxian economics point to its complexity and the political stance that it suggests.\nClassical economists, such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Thomas Malthus, believed that the economy is in a constant state of change and that supply and demand determine the price of goods and services. The main goal of classical economics is to understand the ways in which free trade, competition, and the price mechanism promote the optimal use of resources and an efficient allocation of production. Classical economists have traditionally viewed unemployment as the result of wages that are too high and of low business profitability. Critics of classical economics argue that its assumptions are unrealistic and that classical economists overstate the efficiency of the free market system.\nNeoclassical economists, also known as mainstream economists, are concerned with perfect competition, marginal productivity, utility, and the efficient use of economic resources.", "text2": " The Economic Schools of Thought are about as complicated as those of the medical, psychological, or scientific professions.\nAre you thinking of getting a cat or dog?\nAre you deciding to build a house?\nWould you prefer black ink pens or permanent markers?\nWould you prefer distilled or spring water?\nWould you like salt or black pepper on your eggs?\nWould you like ice or heat with your drink (hot coffee versus Iced tea)?\nWould you like Margarine, Butter, or Olive Oil?\nOr would it just all be better with Marshmallows and whipped cream??\nNow what is so damn complicated about economics??\nThere exists a variety of economic ideas, or what I (and most people here on the forum) call \u201cEconomics Schools.\u201d\nSchool is an appropriate metaphor.

Thus, at the end of the day, each person is poorer, despite the fact that his salary goes up with the inflation.\nA typical example of hyperinflation was in the Weimar Republic, which happened after Germany lost World War I.\nThe economy of Germany was broken, and a high proportion of its former army and elite leaders were either killed or imprisoned. The US government (according to the Treaty of Versailles) demanded to pay reparations to the Germans. Thus, the Germans started printing money. But as this continued, the value of each coin started falling down.\nToday, another candidate for hyperinflation is Zimbabwe, which had not been coping with the rising price levels. The government increased prices, and introduced new coins in 2009.\nAccording to the Zimbabwean government, the inflation has dropped significantly, but according to other reports, the situation still remains dire.\nQ: How do the governments deal with hyperinflation?\nA: By reducing the amount of money in circulation.", "text2": " Hyperinflation is a period in the life of an economy when prices go through the roof.

I don\u2019t have a problem with this; it seems appropriate that the lottery money goes to the local governments in the same way property taxes do. After all, local governments are often responsible for the cost of education in their area.\nThe federal position reversal on internet gambling means that a certain amount of the money coming from the State of Kansas to local governments will not come from that lottery.

When you purchase an airline ticket, no seat has been officially reserved for you; if the flights you are looking to take are full when your transaction takes places (whether you're purchasing through a third-party agency or directly from a specific airline's website) the airlines will designate that the seat on that particular plane is overbooked and mark a \"status of N\" in the seating chart for each of the oversold seats (you can check each reservation record if you log into the airlines' website to see these values).\nSo what happens when an airline has passengers who bought seats on that particular plane and that particular itinerary?", "text3": "What is the process?

None of those costs go up or down as housing is generally not produced in the same way other goods are.\nWhen looking at a house, the most important item that determines the price is not the raw materials or the cost of building the house, but the land the house sits on.

The lender wants to know what are the odds you'll default on the loan.  A credit score is a quick snapshot to judge someone.", "text1": " There are many different credit scoring models (like FICO and VantageScore), and lenders use one or more to make the determination of whether to grant credit. Generally speaking, credit scores show lenders how likely it is that you'll make your payments on time. The lower your credit score is, the more risk you represent to a lender.\nYour credit score can range from 300 to 850. Generally speaking, anything above 650 will get you the best interest rate, and the lower you are below that, the more expensive it will be to borrow.\nQ: What's a FICO score? How does it affect me?\nA: FICO scores were developed by Fair Isaac Corporation to help lenders assess risk. The credit score used by a lender may or may not be a FICO score; however, it is widely accepted and lenders generally understand how they work.\nFICO scores are created by combining several different pieces of information, some of which are listed here:\n1. Your payment history: FICO scores take into account your entire credit history, not just the past five or seven years.\n2. Amounts owed: Amounts owed represent the amount of money you have borrowed and are still obligated to pay back. The FICO score does not count money borrowed that is already paid back.\n3.

You can, for example, have an 850 in your report but it may show to the lender that actually your score is more in the range of, or between 675 - a decent score - to as low as 575. Why? Because the lenders have their own \"secret formulae\" or \"proprietary blend.\" So what the FICO score considers in the top score could be one item, whereas another lender might consider it only as 10% or 15% or 40% towards what they consider your top score. That's why I am always saying that your FICO score could be anywhere between 450 to 850, or between 700 to less then that and that it's totally feasible.\nQ: What's an \"experian credit score?\nA, The FICO score is just one credit score that the big three credit reporting companies provide.

So in this example, assuming Bezos' shares had 0 cost basis, his $10m sale would trigger a $2m tax bill. Not nothing, but basically a rounding error vs. his wealth.\nThe other way that some wealthy reduce taxable income is through a business. By deducting expenses \"for the business\" they can cut their taxable income and buy things with pre-tax dollars.

{"prefix": "Q: Why is inflation such a big issue in so many countries now?\nA:", "gold": "Inflation is a very complex issue. It's one of the reasons it's so hard to entirely stop. People like to blame inflation on the idea that we make print too much money, but it's more complex than just that. The current inflation spike we're seeing is, like many other things in the world today, because of covid and the the supply and demand problem.\nIn Economics 101 you learn of supply and demand. If there is a high supply and low demand for a good, the price of each individual good will be low. If there is high demand and low supply, the price for each individual good will be higher.\nFor the past year and a half consumers haven't been spending as much money. If people don't buy things, companies make less of them and stores stock less of them. (ie \"low demand\") However, people are now returning to old spending patterns, but the production has been slow to adjust. So the demand for goods has gone up without the supply to match it, thus the price of each individual good has gone up.\nThe second factor for the current inflation spike is a consequence of the governments efforts to keep the economy afloat when people weren't buying as much. Mainly this was done by the fed lowering interest rates to near 0%. That's a complex topic in and of itself as to what that actually means. However, for our purposes all you need to know is that near 0 interest rate means that people are taking out loans, primarily mortgages, to take advantage of the low interest and gain property. Unfortunately, the housing market is also limited which drives up the price for each home. \nAll this combines to make the current purchasing power of a dollar less than what it was, or at least make the market see it as such. That's not to say you should go out and try and buy things that hold their value.

It has a range of economic and social consequences that can be difficult to manage. Inflation is the general increase in the prices of goods and services over time. This can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of money, making it more difficult for individuals and businesses to maintain their standard of living. Inflation can also lead to a rise in unemployment, as companies struggle to maintain their profitability with increased costs.\nInflation can also have a major impact on government budgets, as inflation reduces the purchasing power of tax revenue. This can lead to budget deficits and increased government debt, which can lead to further economic instability. In addition, inflation can lead to a shift in consumer spending habits, as people try to save more of their money to protect against future increases in prices. This can lead to a decrease in economic growth, as consumer spending is an important driver of economic activity.\nInflation can also lead to a loss of competitiveness for a country\u2019s exports, as higher prices make its goods and services less attractive to foreign buyers. This can lead to a decrease in foreign investment, as investors look for countries with more stable economic conditions.

Like \u201cthe little old lady driving down a residential street would rather say it\u2019s the price of coffee\u201d instead of looking to central bankers or the government\u2019s policies to explain how inflation could be so rampant.\nWhat\u2019s most interesting to me about the inflation story these days is not the causes or the eventual nature or size or timing of the price rises. Nor is it the media and their amazingly bad take on what we should do to prepare. My favorite real estate and economics podcast called \u201cTalkin\u2019 About Real Estate\u201d is actually telling you not to buy real estate. Not in one-on-one conversations.\nYet they said this week that, in the mid-1970s, the whole concept of home owning is what got things going. Not so much a real estate boom but the confidence of the country and of central bankers, who had expected the little old lady at the coffee shop to buy more. That when prices went up everywhere \u2014 but especially in things you can buy or eat every day.\nInflation will be reduced in the coming months.", "text3": "It is not sustainable. Prices are not going to continue increasing indefinitely. The issue lies in the widespread belief that inflation is an external force rather than a natural occurrence in specific sectors. The average person prefers to blame the cost of coffee rather than considering the role of central bankers or government policies in explaining high inflation rates. I find the most intriguing aspect of the inflation narrative to be neither the reasons behind it nor the eventual outcome in terms of price increases. The media's misguided advice on how to prepare is also not the most intriguing aspect. The podcast \"Talkin' About Real Estate\" advises against purchasing real estate. Not in private discussions. However, they mentioned this week that the idea of owning a home in the mid-1970s was what kickstarted everything. The real estate boom was more about the confidence of the country and central bankers, who anticipated increased spending from the average person.

Currency exchange is a market; if you have a free floating currency, the market will determine what the rate is.

If we are to have tradable values then it is not possible to have consistent values. In the case of money, if money's value changes in such a way that it stays relatively consistent with other currencies, this violates the law of tradability. If money's value does not change in such a way that it stays relatively consistent with other currencies, this violates the law of consistency. To have both, we must choose. We must give up on one or the other.\nValues change over time. In order for the change to be tradable, a change of values in one thing implies the same change in all other things. For instance, to have money which keeps pace with inflation, all goods must also change value so that they too keep pace with inflation. For money to keep pace with deflation, all goods must also change value so that they too keep pace with deflation. So if money is to change in value, the rest of the system must also change. If money is to stay the same, then the rest of the system must also stay the same.\nIt is important to distinguish here between absolute and relative prices. If a law of value is to work, it is necessary that values change over time. The market must be in constant flux. This is absolutely necessary for tradable values.

The dealerships buy cars from the manufacturer, and then sell them to individuals like you.  If they don't sell all the cars they buy, then they are loosing money paying for cars sitting on the dealership lot.  Every dealership is different, but many operate on a quota system, where each salesman is assigned a number of cars to sell during a certain period, say 50 cars per month.  Salesmen will be paid a percentage of the cost of each sale, plus a bonus if they sell the car for a relatively high price.  If a salesman is behind their target near the end of the month, they will be more desperate to sell the car, and may be willing to give up their high price bonus in order to meet their sales quota.  That said, not all dealerships operate on a quota system, and even if they do, there is no reason to believe that the quota countdown ends at the end of the month, it could be on the 15th, or the 5th, or whenever.  \nThe non-ELI5 answer is a lot more complicated, as there are different incentives for selling cars at the manufacturer, dealership, and salesman level, any or all of which will contribute to how willing they are to make you a good deal.", "text1": " Some car salesmen might tell you that their dealer has a lot of \"special deals\" to be had at the end of the month.

What you don't hear is that the quotas aren't just for monthly sales, but for the whole year. It's called the car sales cycle. Like a fashion cycle, but not as predictable or based on the same factors. The cycle works like this:\nJanuary is a \"slow\" month. Sales are sluggish and many car buyers are still hunkered down in the cold, their budgets taken over by heating bills. As a result, they're less likely to make large purchases, which includes buying new cars. Salesmen hate January, but many still need to meet quotas, so the best way to do that is to make deals.\nFebruary is a \"good\" month. Sales start to pick up as the cold starts to wear off and more consumers are looking for vehicles that can make it through the snow and ice. Salesmen like February because they don't have to make as many deals, and can make better margins than they could in January.\nMarch is a \"great\" month.

The problem is usually that fiat money does not have any intrinsic value.

In an extreme case, a government could decide to simply stop issuing fiat money altogether. That would leave one with nothing but a pile of paper.\nWhat about a commodity monetary system? It could be a purely metallic monetary system (such as the gold standard). In that case, a number of questions would arise. One is to decide what quantity of metal (such as gold) a monetary unit is to represent. Another question is how a monetary unit can be determined.

The fiat currency has been backed up to gold as opposed to actual gold as the US has done before. When people started pulling gold from their banks (an actual deposit) the US had to say they would no longer back their bank notes to gold. Fiat money allowed the money supply to increase rather than decrease. The value was based on nothing and all that mattered was supply. If the government printed $1 billion bills that would get $1 billion and if the government printed $1 million bills then the supply would get $1 million. The fiat currency would allow inflation to continue forever if the government keeps making new bills, but eventually it'll be so high there would no actual value to the currency.\nQ: What would inflation possibly reset to if the supply of fiat currency would increase forever?\nA: Actually the supply of fiat currency wouldn't increase forever.", "text3": "Inflation cannot persist indefinitely due to the money supply being limited.

The coin was originally created to keep large value coins (quarter, dime, nickel) in circulation for longer. If they did not have a way to make change for them then they would be removed from circulation much quicker than we would like. However, because of technology and the convenience of credit and debit cards the penny is becoming obsolete. We no longer depend on pennies as much as we do credit cards. The pennies would still have a slight effect on the economy, but not a large effect. Some of you may know that pennies are actually made from zinc because of how expensive copper is. If we did end up eliminating pennies we would only have to make them out of zinc which would save us money as well as time. The biggest cost of making pennies would be the cost of mining the copper to create the cents. We also have to keep in mind that if we did take pennies out of our money system then there would be a huge cost to withdraw all of the pennies from circulation. It would cost more to withdraw the pennies than the cost of replacing the current system. Pennies will never be a complete factor of the economy because it is unlikely that the penny will ever be worth more than a cent or a penny would be worth more than 1 cent.", "text2": " Nothing.

{"prefix": "Q: Time Weighted Returns on an investment\nA:", "gold": "There are two major ways to calculate investment returns. Okay, there's dozens, but specifically with regard to your question what you're looking for is the difference between \"time-weighted\" and \"money-weighted\" returns. There are multiple formulas to determine both, and each have their uses. Each dollar you put in or take out is weighted to come out to an aggregate performance number, and it'll look different based on how you weight the dollars in/out. The general difference is that time-weighted return does not factor in the timing of additions/withdrawals, while money-weighted return does. Said another way, time-weighted return shows the return of an investment, money-weighted return shows the return of YOUR investment in that same thing.\nHere's an example. Let's say you buy ABC stock with $10K, then six months later ABC has fallen 50%. On that date, you add an additional $5K and buy ABC stock with it. Over the next six months, ABC rises 100%. If it goes down 50%, it has to rise 100% to get back to even, so ABC's return is flat over this year, and thus your return is also flat on the $10K. But, your return on the additional $5K is 100%. Time-weighted return strips out that lucky timing and measures only the performance of ABC, so your total time-weighted return is still flat on the whole $15K. But, your money-weighted return will be much higher than 0% because the return on the $5K was 100% and it isn't adjusted for.\nIf you didn't make any additions, then your money- and time-weighted returns will be the same. Since you've been contributing regularly, these two weighting methods will produce significantly different total return figures.", "text1": " An investment\u2019s time weighted returns is a simple average of the yearly rates of returns for the entire life of an investment. It\u2019s also called a portfolio time-weighted rate of return. The formula for calculating this is, Time Weighted Returns = [(1 + r1) * (1 + r2) * \u2026 * (1 + rn)]n \u2013 1 where n is the number of years of the investment\u2019s life, and r1, r2, etc., are the year-to-year rates of return. This is a measure that accounts for the effects of external cash flows.\nWhy is the time-weighted return formula useful?\nInvestors want to know the internal growth rates of an investment. The internal rate of return for an investment tells how much an investment\u2019s return varies from year to year. For example, if the annual return is 5% per year, the IRR is 5%. Time weighted returns are useful when there are withdrawals from or contributions to an investment. In those cases, the internal rate of return is modified to account for external flows.\nQ: Systematic Withdrawal Plan\nA: A systematic withdrawal plan allows you to withdraw a fixed percentage of an investment\u2019s value periodically. This is a great retirement tool for investors who don\u2019t want to take chances with their money and don\u2019t want to watch their savings dwindle to nothing. This plan is best suited for investors with long-term time horizons.", "text2": " The question can be interpreted in two ways, firstly from an investment return point of view, or second from a calculations of time weighting over an investment period. As far as the first is concerned there is a section of Financial Toolbox, called Money Weighted rates calculator which is able to answer all questions relating to time value, inflation value, and compounded returns, over an investment period that can be as short term or as long term.
