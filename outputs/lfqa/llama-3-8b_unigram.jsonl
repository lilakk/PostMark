And so, without even knowing what the chemical messenger does in the brain, we can block its action. So we are in a strange world, where we are trying to target a chemical without knowing what it does or even how it is controlled.\nBut I'm OK with that. It's sometimes like this when we first come across a new disease. We try to use existing therapies, or put people on drugs that we can see might have an effect. Sometimes the effects are more apparent than with Ingrezza. At least with Ingrezza, people with tardive dyskinesia got worse while they were on the drug, or better, but there was some variability, and even a \"placebo effect.\" The placebo effect is a special part of the way drugs act in the body. Some people get better on a placebo, even though it is a fake drug. When we use a placebo in a controlled study, we do it in a specific way, using \"blinding\" and using special containers.

Even if the judge does not accept the guilty plea, the prosecuting lawyer will be a step ahead, since the defense lawyer will not know what to prepare for next.\nNow, you can say that in a death penalty case, the prosecutor must present his case to a jury, not a judge. But who is to say a jury of six or more members will accept a guilty verdict when a judge (or even a jury of less than six members) will not?\nThe answer is that they will not. The death penalty has been abolished in most states; in those states where it is still allowed, it is still uncommon for a prosecutor to seek a death sentence.

The first is the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard.

The second is the \"clear and convincing\" standard. This standard is more difficult for a party to prove and it can only be met if the evidence is highly probable.\nBy contrast, in criminal trials in the United States, there is a different burden of proof. This standard is referred to as \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" To meet this burden of proof, the government must prove that the defendant is guilty of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe \"innocent until proven guilty\" rule has its origins in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Fifth Amendment states that a person shall not be \"deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The Supreme Court has interpreted this provision to mean that a person is innocent until proven guilty. This means that the burden of proof is on the government, not the defendant, to prove that a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard is used in civil proceedings because the stakes are generally lower in civil cases.", "text2": "They're different things.\nThe concept that anyone is automatically presumed to be both blameless (\"innocent\" is actually an understatement; blameless is sort of like an adult version of you're-a-bad-bug-and-we'll-have-to-spray-you-with-something that makes you better) is an extremely old concept.\nThe concept of proof is much newer; so is proof-of-innocence.\nI'm almost positive that both of you have played games of scrumcumberdicefart (which is totally valid if you're ten years old) or even played court (but you're twenty-somethings) games of teenage stuff.

Arbitration clauses.\nThe average consumer almost never bargains with a supplier to prevent problems that are likely to arise in the future. The supplier's terms are usually imposed without negotiation. When a consumer signs a contract with such terms, the consumer does not understand, much less control, the scope of mandatory arbitration. In response to this kind of imbalance, at least three-quarters of American states now have legislation limiting the use of consumer arbitration clauses.\nState laws regarding mandatory arbitration clauses vary widely, but most provide one of three basic limitations: They (1) do not permit arbitration clauses that have a class action waiver, (2) do not permit arbitration clauses that waive a party's statutory consumer rights, or (3) provide for a forum selection clause that allows consumers to have disputes adjudicated in their home state courts. In some states, each of these three provisions may exist in one law. Some states have further defined limitations, such as a requirement that a consumer be notified of an arbitration clause's existence and limitations.\nNot surprisingly, the U.S. Supreme Court has been more protective of the right to use arbitration clauses than the states.

The American Civil Liberties Union has argued that the protection is too broad, especially in cases that involve violations of constitutional rights.\nThe argument: \u00a0 Qualified immunity protects officers even if they acted unreasonably because no court or prosecutor has previously said they violated the Constitution.\nSupporters of qualified immunity argue that police officers need the protection from lawsuits in order to perform their jobs.

The attacker then uses the services and in order to prevent discovery, when the bug or vulnerability is discovered by the administrator, the attacker may claim that they never used the system.\nRepudiation attacks are often done by fraudsters that want to steal money from companies, governments, or individual users.

In a jury trial, the jury hears the evidence and decides the case. In a bench trial, the judge decides the case after hearing the evidence. Jury trials are reserved for felony cases. Misdemeanor cases may be tried by a jury, but are generally tried by a judge. Both are referred to as a \u201ctrial by judge or jury.\u201d\nThere are several reasons for the procedure of jury trials. Juries ensure a trial is a public affair in the spirit of justice. Juries are intended to represent the community, and are generally of the same sex as the defendant. Jury trials help keep the courts honest, because the court would be accountable to a jury if the court was biased. Jury trials can help prevent a judge from being influenced by the community in a small town. Jury trials protect against overcharging. Jury trials help resolve disputes outside the community where a small town would affect the trial. Jury trials are the best way to give a defendant an opportunity to prove his or her innocence.\nQ: What is a \u201ctrial by written declaration\u201d?\nA: \u201cTrial by written declaration\u201d is a trial in which the defendant (who is charged with a misdemeanor or infraction offense) and the prosecution both file a written declaration in lieu of an appearance in court.

{"prefix": "Q: How do blacklists work?\nA:", "text1": "In general, blacklists work by listing all the IP addresses (host names are an exception) that are known to be involved in some activity, which is usually spamming. Anti-spam companies are in constant communication with other companies and constantly review their blacklists in order to ensure the most effective operation of their blacklist. So, for instance, when you have the IP address for a computer that was used in sending spam messages, you send that IP address to the anti-spam company you are working with, and they add that IP address to their blacklist.\nWhen you are sending your mail and an anti-spam company reviews your outgoing messages, if that IP address is on the blacklist, that mail is automatically rejected. Some companies also use white lists and allow mail from only specified IP addresses. Thus, if a spammer manages to hack into your mail server and start sending spam, when you turn the server off and on again, you have to wait for that IP address to be removed from the blacklist before you can send mail again. If the blacklists are not removed quickly, you have to wait a few days before you can use that IP address again.\nQ: Why can\u2019t I send mail to a specific address?\nA: The most common reason that a message does not reach a specific address is that the mail server which is trying to relay the message for you is on the blacklist.

In the event the person being subpoenaed doesn\u2019t have any employees at the location or business the party is served at, service may be done by a person over the age of 18 years old who has actual knowledge of the defendant\u2019s whereabouts.\nIf the person served with the subpoena has an employee present, the employee must be informed of their duty to serve the subpoena. In the event the person served with the subpoena refuses to be served with the document, the server can leave the document with a person of suitable age and discretion. In the event the person being served with the subpoena is a minor or ill or otherwise unable to accept the subpoena, then the person may be served at their place of residence. If the person is out of state, the subpoena may be sent through certified mail to their place of residence. If that is unsuccessful, then alternative methods for delivery of the subpoena must be explored.\nIn the event that you are not able to properly serve a subpoena, there are additional steps you must take to validate service.", "text2": "Why would someone who received an arrest warrant want to cover up that you tried to arrest him?

It's important because when your landlord decides to send you a \"notices\" demanding your rent, you may be able to ignore it and even sue the landlord for harassment.\nHere's a legal analysis on eviction moratoriums.\nPlease feel free to ask more specific questions. In general, however, you should be taking any written demand for rent or for payment of any other bills seriously. Unless you're a resident with a fixed period lease (i.e., 6 months, one year), your landlord must provide a notice to terminate. Typically, this is 60 days. Once the period ends, the landlord can begin the process of serving you with an eviction notice. The eviction notice will give you 5 days to comply with the demand for rent, usually in the form of a quit-notice. It could also be a notice that your landlord intends to enter into your apartment. If your landlord enters your apartment without a valid notice, the landlord can be held liable for your actual damages (injury to property or bodily injury), as well as punitive damages. You can also sue the landlord for harassment in small claims court.

This law was designed to violate Roe v. Wade and eliminate access to abortion in Texas.

If the plaintiff wins, they receive $10,000 and their legal fees. This means that anyone, not just anti-abortion activists, could file a lawsuit against an abortion provider or a patient trying to obtain an abortion.\nSB8 is designed to be so difficult to challenge that abortion clinics across Texas have already begun closing down in order to avoid prosecution. The law is so extreme that most doctors, and many legal experts, do not feel that it is safe to provide abortion care in the state of Texas.\nDespite a federal ruling which blocks the law in part, we do not know how long this legal protection will last. On October 8, 2021, the Supreme Court declined to block the law. This means that it is in effect and that the legal framework of the law remains intact.

Or, maybe your reader's expectations were such that they would never have believed something else to begin with.\nSo why do we (as readers) fall for it? Well, we're used to being tricked in a way. All stories, especially those involving a \"twist,\" involve a reliance on the reader to accept, at some point, something that is not true. It's not something you can hide, because even the most fantastic or farfetched tale relies on a suspension of disbelief.

As with many legal issues, it can be tricky to prove that the person you're seeking to hold responsible for harm caused did actually cause the harm. In order to prove that the person you're looking to hold responsible is, in fact, the person who caused the harm, you have to show either direct or proximate cause.

Some might argue that there is an attempt to suppress certain elements of the voter base that typically might be expected to gravitate towards liberal tendencies; however an alternate view is that perhaps certain citizens that might gravitate towards liberal policies do not have to show an ID.\nIf my colleague is right that voters ID legislation is an attempt to preserve the values that that Americans have deemed to be historically desirable; then is that so bad? Consider that an ID can serve to confirm ones identity; therefore should that ID be required to preserve that sense of identity?

One perspective suggests voter ID laws could be targeting specific groups with liberal leanings, while another viewpoint is that those individuals may not need to show identification. Is it really such a negative thing if voter ID laws are meant to uphold traditional American values, as my colleague suggested? Should an ID be necessary to maintain one's sense of identity? Should an ID be necessary to confirm voter eligibility and maintain a sense of eligibility? Should an ID be necessary to maintain a sense of eligibility and confirm one's identity for voting purposes? I believe that voter ID laws are aimed at protecting important American values.

Alford (1970) in which the Court held that a person could be sentenced after pleading guilty, even if he maintained his factual innocence.\nThe rule\u2019s purpose was to deal with some practical problems that arise in sentencing. For instance, if someone maintains his factual innocence, there are many sentencing options open to the court. The court might order a medical or psychological evaluation or even sentence a defendant to a term of imprisonment. A sentence might also be put on hold to see whether an offender complies with probation or court-ordered treatment.\nThere are two requirements for an Alford plea. The court must determine that the defendant understands the nature of the charge and is aware of the rights that he or she is waiving. It also must determine that there is a factual basis for the charge and that the defendant is knowingly waiving his or her right to a trial and has done so voluntarily.

When voters legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, a robust black market remained. In part, this is because the state has failed to open enough retail stores to satisfy demand. This time around, a much greater number of retail licenses will be available and some portion of them could be located in communities where people may have been arrested for low-level offenses before legalization.

However, people cannot self-certify death if they have any reason to believe the deceased is alive.\nDeath is legally declared when the last body part is removed by a medical professional.

{"prefix": "Q: Why does America have different laws per state? Why not simply have the same laws country-wide?\nA:", "text1": "There are two basic reasons: 1) Federal law. For example, abortion, and taxation (federal law controls national defense, foreign affairs, interstate commerce, the rights of foreigners, etc.); and 2) Federalism.\nFederalism is the system of government in which powers are divided between a central government and various constituent entities. This helps achieve a better degree of democracy and, indeed, freedom.\nFor example, Canada is a federation of 10 provinces and 3 territories, governed from Ottawa, Ontario. The federal government in Canada legislates in matters of defense, citizenship, and national economic policy. Provinces control education, social programs, welfare, and natural resources (such as minerals and trees). So it is that a Canadian province could require that one of its citizens working for the government has three years of post-secondary education, but could not prohibit the sale of marijuana, since it is a federal matter.\nIn America, of course, things are quite different because, over the years, there have been different numbers of states in the union. This means that at certain points in our nation's history, the powers of state governments had to vary. The larger states tended to have more powers than the smaller ones.\nWith the rise of the industrial revolution in the U.S., however, this disparity in powers began to fade, and eventually state legislatures were left with fewer powers.", "text2": "That would be great if only all of us Americans agreed on what \u201cthe same\u201d is.\nConfronting issues like abortion is no different to my way of reasoning.\nI don\u2019t believe that abortion is always right; however all choices we adults can have to choose abortion has to be available to us \u2013 regardless of what we believe is right!\nIf we adults believe that an abortion is \u201csin\u201d \u2013 then we have no right to decide that abortions should be banned if we won\u2019t get out of bed to fight against things that can result into abortion (like no money to provide for their family etc)\nIf an abortion is \u201csin\u201d then we should fight that off instead of banning abortions to save lives that we believe have to be saved!\nThe choices of abortion should be available to all American citizens \u2013 you choose to be an adult \u2013 then you choose to bear its fruits of consequences!\nThe same law is only applicable to us if we can all see eye to eye on what is \u201cthe same\u201d law.\nOtherwise we have to choose to allow freedom to choose what is right \u2013 even if we disagree on what is \u201cthe same\u201d.\nIs that what you want?\nI can show you what \u201cthe same\u201d is \u2013 you choose to follow me if you believe that my way is better!\nOtherwise you have to allow me to follow you if you believe that you have what is right.\nThe true \u201cthe same\u201d is what is equally free to all choices.", "text3": "It would be wonderful if all Americans could come to a consensus on what \"the same\" means.

The Kingpin Act helps to identify criminals who are in the business of moving dollars around and is supposed to stop them.

When the opposition is about to lose control of the puck, as it crosses the blue line, they form a half circle of players around it. So if one of their number is on the far side of the blue line he can prevent the opposition from passing the puck and taking control of it, thus creating the opportunity for the opposition to skate into his half of the ice unopposed.\nThe penalty is given to the offending player, but the goal scored by the opposition remains valid.\nQ: What is a \u201chit from behind\u201d and why is it called that?\nA: When a player who has the puck attempts to skate by another player he may be \u201cchecked from behind.\u201d It is a foul and the offending player is penalized.

{"prefix": "Q: How can people get convicted of multiple counts of murder when there is only one victim?\nA:", "text1": "Usually when there are multiple victims of a crime, the people accused of the crime are tried separately on each count. For example, there may be two people charged with one murder. Each person could face one murder charge because both individuals participated in the murder. It is less common when only one person is involved in the murder. I think that in those circumstances multiple murder charges are used to punish that person for their heinous act. Murder has different degrees and by breaking up the murder into different counts, the person can be charged with higher degrees of murder. Ultimately, a person charged with multiple murder charges will be tried for all of the counts at the same time.\nIn California, it is possible for people to get convicted of multiple counts of murder even though there is only one victim. There are two ways that this can happen. The first is that the crime happened on federal property and a federal criminal statute allows people to be charged with multiple murder charges even though there is only one victim. An example of this is the U.S. military. The federal criminal statute applicable to military property allows commanders to charge people with multiple counts of murder even when there is only one victim.\nThe second way is for someone to be charged with murder for multiple acts that all happened in the same incident.

I actually lived through it, or at least had to witness it.\nIn 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed a bill for the Gun Control Act of 1968, which would be a huge step in regulating the gun industry. This bill would force gun makers to sell guns to the US government, and the government would sell those guns to law enforcement and police officers at 25 cents each. This means that the price of guns had fallen dramatically, and there was a huge rise in gun sales, leading to more guns out in the streets.\nHow did this get out? Well, if you have any knowledge of the US, it is simple; politics. In the 1980\u2019s, the NRA had grown to a point where they were the biggest lobby in the country, and that meant they could use their power to manipulate gun laws in any way they wanted. They passed gun legislation that would let anyone buy guns, and there was nothing we could do to stop them.\nWhat does this have to do with California? Well, the NRA was lobbying to get guns in the hands of California, and they passed a gun law that gave any Californian the right to buy a gun without a license, without a permit, and without any sort of background check.

In fact, according to a survey conducted by Insurance.com, some 69% of those surveyed stated that texting while driving should be an offense equal to driving while impaired. Thus, why is there a discrepancy? The simple answer is that law makers consider this to be a far greater threat to society, and as a result are willing to put more teeth into the law in order to deter this behavior.\nAdditionally, the last few years have seen more and more attention paid to this issue. Public service announcements, commercials, and educational campaigns are all aimed at stopping this behavior. As a result, many states have begun to take a more proactive stance in the fight against distracted driving, much like they have for years with drunk driving.\nQ: If I am stopped for a moving violation and I refuse to submit to a chemical breath or urine test, will the court be able to convict me of driving under the influence of alcohol, if the officer didn\u2019t see me drinking?\nA: No. The police need a solid foundation of evidence in order to prove DUI. Without actual proof of alcohol consumption, such as the presence of an open alcohol container in your car or other such proof, the officer needs to have probable cause for arresting you for drunk driving. This could be the odor of alcohol on your breath or your slurred speech, both of which indicate that you have been drinking.

In my experience, the reason for this contrast remains unknown to all of us. The term 'Driving Under Influence' can refer to both active THC and metabolized THC, which can be detected hours to days after consumption. Driving under the influence of drugs is distinct from driving under the influence of alcohol.

This type of thing is generally done with the use of DNA analysis. (Or so I'm told)\nQ: Why is it that it is hard to identify decomposed bodies?\nA: There are several reasons. First, an advanced decomposition body may be more difficult to identify because of the loss of bodily structures. This would include parts of the body, hair, fingerprints and so forth. Body systems may also disintegrate, as well as organs. When a body is advanced, the bones may begin to lose the hard elements and become more or less porous in composition. During advanced decomposition, the bones become more brittle and fractures of the bones will occur, making it difficult for investigators to tell where the bone ends and where the soil or sediment begin. With such high levels of decomposition, it is difficult to obtain the correct amount of DNA required to identify the body. Finally, an advanced decomposition body may be difficult to identify because it is simply hard to distinguish between a body and the landscape or vegetation, such as when human bones are buried or may have been dismembered and are intermixed with animal bones or animal parts that have been destroyed.

Men also have a tendency to try and have as many children as they can before they can have a decent sex life. Its a vicious cycle.\nIn Japan, there are only 60 million people.

A call gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase shares of an underlying security at a specified price by a specific date. For this right, a call buyer pays a fee, known as a premium, to the call seller (the writer).\nThe goal of buying a call option is to generate profits from a price increase in the underlying stock, or other asset, without having to buy the shares. This allows you to make a leveraged bet on the stock without having to own it outright. If the price of the stock climbs higher than your strike price by the date of expiration, you can sell the call for a profit. You do not have to own the stock to execute this trade.\nA call option that is \"out of the money\" (OTM) has a strike price higher than the current price of the underlying stock. An example of this would be a July call for Apple that has a strike price of $120 with the stock trading at $108. In this scenario, the stock would need to rise to at least $120 to see a profit. A \"put option\" is the same thing, except you are looking for the stock to decline in price, so you're looking at a strike price that is lower than the stock's current price.", "text2": "An investor who is bearish on a given market can purchase put options that allow him to sell the security later on at that price.\nPut options give you the right to sell shares of an S&P ETF (e.g.,\u00a0SPY) to an investor if you want to sell later on.\nIf you want to sell that ETF because you believe that its price is going to fall, you have bought an appropriate put.\nIf you decide to sell that ETF shares later on (for whatever price you want to sell to) you get to exercise that put.\nThere is no obligation to exercise that put if you believe that ETF is no longer going to fall.\nYou can sell (close) that put to another investor if you want to (of if you want to purchase another put).\nIf you decide to exercise that put to sell that ETF shares you get an amount of cash equal to (minus) that put price that you have bought.\nThe profit you earn is equal to (minus) that put price you have bought.\nExample of Put options on S&P ETF (SPY)\nA put that costs you to purchase USD$3 (you pay USD$3 to another investor to purchase that put) means that you have decided to sell that ETF later on if you want to sell (not an obligation) at that price.\nIf you exercise that put to sell (not an obligation) that ETF later on you get an amount of cash equal to (minus) that USD$3.", "text3": "A bearish investor can buy put options to sell the security at a specified price in the future.

A bank doesn't have to loan money at a lower rate than inflation to do so.

{"prefix": "Q: How does short-selling work?\nA:", "text1": "Short-selling is a way to bet that the price of a security will go down. The short-seller first borrows the security (a stock or a bond) from the owner. The short-seller then sells the security to an investor at a higher price, hoping to buy it back at a lower price and return it to the owner, pocketing the difference.\nQ: Why do some corporations and individuals use short-selling?\nA: Short-selling can be used as part of a strategy to increase overall returns. This is known as hedging. The investor is betting that the price of a security will drop, while simultaneously holding other investments.\nFor example, a hedge fund might buy stock in two companies -- one growing rapidly, one slowing. It also might bet that the price of the stock in the slower-growing company will decline. If the price of the faster-growing stock increases in value, but the price of the other stock drops, the hedge fund will have realized a profit.\nHowever, short-selling doesn\u2019t come without risk. If the price of the stock increases, the investor will lose money.\nQ: Does short-selling always make money for the short-seller?\nA: It does not. Short-sellers who \"short\" a stock can be called wrong and lose their entire investment on the position. For example, suppose a hedge fund shorts 1 million shares of XYZ Corp. stock for $10 a share.", "text2": "Investors have two main ways to profit on stocks: Buy shares below their price (before a rise) so you can sell above their price (after that rise) so you profit on that rise.\nThe short seller takes that strategy to its inverse.

Let's say you bought a stock at $50 and then the price of the stock is at $100. If you sell the stock, the buyer of the stock has to buy it from you for $100 and pay you. You then give the stock to the buyer of the stock. The other option is that your broker sells your stock for you and gives you the cash from the sale.

For this reason, it does not have to borrow from the private sector. In practice, the government needs to spend its own money to influence its economy. That\u2019s why we refer to it as a sovereign currency issuer or sovereign issuer.\nSo, in a regime in which taxes and debt issuance are in the sovereign currency, what are the limits on the sovereign currency issuer? One limit is inflation. In the United States, our central bank, the Federal Reserve, acts as the inflation-fighter. Our central bank, the Federal Reserve, has been doing a lot of this lately.\nA: Sure, all countries, whatever their size or wealth, have some form of fiscal sovereignty, or sovereignty to spend their own currency. But I don\u2019t know any government that\u2019s an issuer of its own currency which is free of any obligation to obey its own laws.\nThe poor person in the slum in Bangladesh can\u2019t pay their taxes with rubles or a loan in euros.

The development of Economics is the story of economics as a science of production. The economic theory started as the basic concept of Labor Theory of Value, where it was assumed that all value was created only through human labor. It was later found that not all value is created by human labor. Our production takes place in nature as well, and nature also adds value to our products. This is how natural resources started to be considered in the economic theory. Human labor and natural resources are then combined with human mind and skill, human entrepreneurship. In the latest phase of economic development, capital goods are playing a major role in our production and economic theory now takes into account not only human labor and natural resources, but also the capital equipment which is the best representative of the progress of the science and the technology of human civilization.\nNow that we understand the evolution of economic theory, let us look at the various economic schools of thought, starting from the school of thought which was the oldest:\nLabor Theory of Value : Labor theory of value states that all value was created only through human labor.

It's very common for people to buy tickets online or at a counter and just not show up.

For example, they'll force passengers to have their credit card on file to secure a ticket that's non-refundable.

Sometimes it can be as simple as a crew member not counting a passenger at the time of check-in.

How can inflation be (historically) fairly low while the price of housing has skyrocketed, both in absolute and relative terms?\nA:", "text1": "Housing is a different animal. Housing price inflation was somewhat mitigated by historically low interest rates and I imagine that high inflation of other things would cause it to rise less.

This means that relative to other expenses, housing does not need to inflate as much to make an impact on the average person. There are also many people who aren't in a position to buy a house. Housing price inflation isn't felt by them. Also there is the interesting aspect of how house prices don't inflate by a linear amount but rather geometrically. As houses go up in price, the price of a second house also goes up geometrically (also due to interest rates and economy) meaning the gap gets larger, more people are priced out of housing, and on the other hand, houses get larger and more expensive. The final point is that the prices that are talked about don't account for the labor and materials that went into making the house. Those can also get inflated in high inflationary periods. The end result is that housing is just a different market. It is also very large, and includes the most expensive homes for the richest people (e.g. billionaires).

{"prefix": "Q: Why is inflation such a big issue in so many countries now?\nA:", "text1": "Inflation is a special type of price increase. It\u2019s a significant increase in the cost of living over a longer period of time. In the US, it is calculated as a yearly percentage increase in the cost of a group of items and services purchased by households. When prices rise rapidly, it becomes more difficult to afford everyday things like food and transportation.\nQ: What are the main causes of inflation?\nA: There are different causes of inflation:\nProduction cost increases: When the costs of the goods and services used to produce a good rise, it causes prices to go up.\nDemand increases: If there is more demand than supply, the prices of goods and services may increase to encourage producers to make more goods and services and to discourage people from buying too much.\nMonetary policy: When the central bank prints and distributes more money, it causes more money to chase the same goods and services. This causes inflation to rise.\nQ: Why are central banks so concerned about inflation?\nA: Inflation reduces the value of your money. For example, if you have $100 today, in a year\u2019s time it will be worth less, because it will be able to buy fewer goods. The central bank is the regulator of the financial system, and it tries to maintain a stable environment for its economy, in order to promote prosperity.\nWhen inflation is high, people tend to have less confidence in their economy.", "text2": "Even though prices have gone up over much of the post- World War II period; including during both of \u201cGreat\u201d recessions of my adult working years (the early to mid-1980s recession of late stagflation years and the late-2000s recession of \u201cthe great financial recession\u201d that resulted from excesses of loose money policies) combined with the technological advancements of computers etc that should be deflationary.\nA big issue of policy is that price increases that can be conveniently labeled \u201cinflation\u201d have become steeper rather that \u201ccost increases\u201d (including wages) which is rising costs of living \u201cinflation\u201d during COVID-19.\nIf you accept that governments of so many countries expanded their money supply excessively (which is very much up to \u201cdate\u201d \u2013 regardless of questions about which policy makers who have facilitated \u201cprinting\u201d money) then can we accept that \u201cprinting\u201d of money is \u201cinflation\u201d which is an ongoing problem.\nA question is to what extent policy is \u201cconventional\u201d (ie policy of government through legislative means) vs \u201cunconventional\u201d (ie policy of central bankers to \u201ccut\u201d interest rates to low to negative).", "text3": "Despite the fact that prices have increased during most of the post-World War II era, including the two major recessions in my working years, advancements in technology like computers should lead to deflation.

This is not surprising, since commodities and bonds are unique while derivatives are more similar, or standardized. So the time and resources needed to create a contract are usually not a great burden on either party. However, if the parties are not quite sure what is going to happen in the future, then the use of derivatives can help to facilitate the transfer of risk.

If rising inflation continues to be a thing, what would happen if the governments/banks didn't raise interest rates and just left them at their historically low levels?\nA:", "text1": "Inflation is the number of times a bank note can buy as much as it could have previously.

The higher the inflation rate, the poorer we are because we are losing purchasing power. An example of this is the $100 that I might have saved three years ago might only buy one cup of coffee today, compared with two cups of coffee back then.\nInflation also erodes the value of money. For example, if I own a house and sell it for $600,000 three years ago and buy a new house for $600,000 today, I am in the same financial position, however the value of my home has reduced to 66% (two cups of coffee).

When the first bank opened it's doors it simply issued a promissory note, made deposits for that note and then loaned that money out and started the process over again. By and large, the bank only held a few % of its total cash reserves in hand. Thus if everyone who had a deposit or loan demanded their money back, the bank would go belly up because it only had a few dollars in reserves. The bankers knew this and understood that there was enough trust in the public for them to continue this cycle.\nA: YES. Banks loan money into existence. Any money that is created by a bank for a loan is created without any loss in any other bank's money reserves. Any money that is deposited into a bank is created as the bank has an obligation to the depositor and does not have to be held in reserve. Thus any money that banks loan out is created from thin air (the money supply). Banks don't hold reserves for all the money they loan out as this would cause any bank to go out of business because it would take all their money from their reserves and they would have no money left to operate.\nQ: How is money created?\nA: The Federal Reserve creates money electronically as debt.

In order to do this, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, will sell U.S. treasury bonds and other government debt securities. The Federal Reserve will also reduce the supply of dollars in circulation to combat hyperinflation.\nOther measures of hyperinflation can include credit controls, cutting government spending, cutting taxes, reducing deficits, decreasing money supply, and increasing interest rates.

{"prefix": "Q: why is it not economical to convert ICE cars to EV's?\nA:", "text1": "mainly because of the cost of buying new batteries. It costs about $15,000 to put in new lithium ion batteries. These batteries are usually meant to last 10 years but they only last 5 years in reality, and even then they are very old and out of date by the time they are installed in a 2015 car. Batteries of this type are very expensive even new. But here's the catch: The battery lifetime and capacity depends heavily on the way you drive the car. If you only do short distances, the battery will go faster. Also if you drive at very low speeds, the battery goes faster. This makes sense because you have high current at low voltage, and battery lifetime depends on high current, and low voltage. Batteries degrade 5 times faster at 40% SOC. So the more you drive, the less time the battery will last. In the USA there is an average 7,700 miles per year per car, but most are not used that much. If people would buy a decent amount of EV miles, then they could add more. But at the moment, batteries are mostly a liability in cars. So the best thing to do is to use less electricity, use it for non critical things like air conditioners and refrigerators. And when you do need some miles, you should rent the vehicle instead of buying.", "text2": "Because of their huge amount of battery needed to replace IC engine.\nAn approximate overall figure of electric to IC equivalent is approx.8 -.88 KwH of electric to replace about two g of IC.\nThe percentage goes up if you consider to build of battery parts.\nThe percentage goes up even more if you include aluminum of Lithium mining.\nAn approximate overall figure of electric to IC equivalent is approx.8 -.88 KwH of electric to replace about two g of IC.\nThe percentage goes up if you consider to build of battery parts.\nThe percentage goes up even more if you include aluminum of Lithium mining.\nThe cost of building an electric car is what needs to be included.\nIts construction costs much much much less than an IC car.\nNot to mention its much less heavy.\nThe cost of building an electric car is what needs to be included.\nIts construction costs much much much less than an IC car.\nNot to mention its much less heavy.\nDo you have any hard facts about that?\nThat is hard to figure out.\nHowever my neighbour lives on out skirts of Paris so has to pay expensive parking fees which makes him want an electric car.\nHowever my neighbour lives on out skirts of Paris so has to pay expensive parking fees which makes him want an electric car.\nDo you have an approximate cost of both?\nI can only guess that electric car is about double to build.\nIs that even remotely true?

{"prefix": "Q: Why cant someone fix a province/country by building places for tourism, especially if it was on a sea or something, it would get alot of tourism income. So dont governers do that\nA:", "text1": "Since this is a \"GOVERNMENT\" not a \"RACE\" we do not govern provinces just countries. They are fixed. Every province has 3 categories of income from: factories, tourism, and resource collecting. Building more tourism objects may increase tourism income a little but if the province is otherwise less attractive, there are better ways to increase that income category.\nTo show an example, look at Greenland and Denmark. Greenland is pretty well closed down to tourism due to climate but Denmark has a tourism income of 234. Greenland has a tourism income of 9. This is because Denmark's tourism industries are more attractive then Greenland's. The factories are generally built by the AI. In some cases a governor will focus on building his factories but there is generally no real need to do this.\nThe same goes for resources. If an area is not rich in resources (and the area has resource gathering sites) the resources will not be gathered. To show an example of this, in the AFR example we released, the AFR have a corn resource income of 156 (with all the African countries that export corn) yet Nigeria has a corn income of 161 and South Africa has a corn income of 151 (the most recent values). The reason for this is the AI built more resource gathering sites in the AFR than in those two countries.", "text2": "First of all fixing poverty is actually only half of poverty (the poverty quota) because you have to maintain stability (I guess stability would be an inequality quota) if you have stability then you can start fixing poverty.\nSecond of all poverty has nothing to do with working on building things to earn money so therefore you should build up an industry to get money to build stuff instead of building stuff to get money to build stuff.\nThen ofcourse you get my personal view on tourism which is that building stuff should get you money per day on its own (like an industry) so you can build stuff without even have to worry about economic shit.\nI suggest that you start building up an industry instead of building tourist places because that way you can build up an industry which you can then add to get more money per x amount of days to get faster on building up tourist places which get you money on its own.", "text3": "Addressing poverty is only part of the solution, as maintaining stability is also crucial in reducing inequality and improving economic conditions.

{"prefix": "Q: What would it mean for the American economy if we eliminated the 1-cent penny from our system of currency?\nA:", "text1": "First, we would be getting rid of some very old coins that, despite not having much actual monetary value, still have great sentimental value. The coins themselves are made from various metals; pennies were made from bronze until 1982, and are now made of zinc. The 1-cent penny isn't the only old coin that is still in use. The nickel, dime, and quarter all have their origins in the colonial era and have been largely unchanged ever since.\u00a0\nPerhaps the biggest reason for keeping these old coins around is that many businesses still charge in round dollar amounts, for example by charging $9.99 for a product instead of $10.00. By using an old coin, people avoid the awkwardness of having to hand out an amount that isn't evenly divisible by ten. Eliminating the penny would simply make things a little bit easier.\u00a0\nIt's true that a penny is only a cent of the value of the goods that it pays for, so it would be better to pay in small bills or in the higher-value coins. The penny would only cover the change on the price of some things; however, if we all started to get rid of the pennies, a different kind of problem would arise. Imagine trying to pay for something with a 50-cent coin, for example. You might have to go up to the cashier and say, \"That's 80 cents, and here's a 50-cent coin.", "text2": "Eliminating pennies would cost us up to $5 billion because of all of us would be spending money we would have to send to replace all of the pennies that we have lost over the years.\nThe United States has two base types of money that we have to deal with to pay things that we have to pay for - cash money like dollar bills & pennies & money that we carry on computers like credit cards.\nIf we had no pennies we would all have to pay an amount less then we would have to pay if we had pennies to pay things.\nI like to have pennies because pennies cost almost no money to have.\nThere is another cost to have pennies that is like to have nickles & like to have pennies.\nA penny is like to have nickle & like to have penny.\nA nickle is like to have penny & like to have nickle.\nA dime is like to have pennie & like to have dime.\nA dollar is like to have dime & like to have dollar.\nA dollar bill is like to have penny & like to have dollar.\nThe USA is on computers that we all can be have - like computers that we can be have - & computers that we can pay to have computers.\nComputers have computers that we can be have & pay to have computers.\nComputers that we can be have & pay to have computers have computers that we can be have & pay to have computers.", "text3": "Getting rid of pennies would result in a $5 billion cost due to the need to replace lost coins.

{"prefix": "Q: Time Weighted Returns on an investment\nA:", "text1": "You can calculate your own time weighted returns for different periods by using our free returns calculator. This is an especially useful tool for calculating IRR, MIRR, and geometric returns over longer periods of time. It's also useful for seeing returns from different start dates.\nHere's an example of using the returns calculator to see the time weighted returns for a model of the S&P 500 from its inception in 1926 through 1999:\nAs you can see, the absolute returns for the whole period were 1,835%. The geometric return was 9.72%. However, the time weighted return was 11.04% over the 73 year period. The table on the left side shows the cumulative performance of the model fund.\nQ: What's the geometric mean return?\nA: The geometric mean is the compounded annualized growth rate for an investment. It's similar to IRR, but it takes into account the compounding of returns. For example, a simple investment of $100 earning a 7% annual return for 5 years will yield $170 at the end of the period. A 7% annualized geometric mean return is more accurate than an internal rate of return in this case.\nIn simple cases, the geometric mean will be the same as the IRR.
