{"prefix": "Q: Why do \"at-will\" employment states have probation periods at work?\nA:", "text1": "The federal law of the US doesn\u2019t offer legal protection for workers, such as wage discrimination, so there is no such thing as at-will employment. At-will employment laws were established by some states where there is a state statute, or a common law right based on state public policy, that generally prohibits an employer from terminating an employee for a discriminatory or retaliatory reason. These laws have common features that require an employer to provide a reason for the termination to be considered justified. This is due to the fact that employees of these states generally have more rights than other workers, such as those who are employed in other states where the employee has no protection, unless the federal law provides one.\nThe major difference between the two is the way the employee is fired in each of these states. A probationary employee in an at-will employment state is subject to immediate termination without a hearing. This is a rare case, as most employers prefer to talk with the employee who\u2019s being fired to determine the true nature of the situation. In an at-will state, however, an employer may fire the employee immediately after having hired them. In a probationary state, the employer must provide a valid reason for the termination and give the employee a chance to defend themselves.\nIn a probationary state, a job termination does not necessarily mean that the employee is automatically fired, nor does it necessarily mean that the employer must give the employee a chance to prove their innocence.", "text2": "The nature of at-will in an employment-at-will state is an employer can fire an employee for any reason, under any conditions, at any time. With this form of labor law responsibility, the employer can be protected by an appropriate probation period. The simple explanation is that an employer can hire the employee during a probationary period then fire him without having to justify the reason. For a top-notch employment law attorney, drones to ProPublica and the Washington Post like Wade Vanderveen for assistance with labor law matters, including the aforementioned point to consider for employers who want to take advantage of the at-will doctrine.\nThe term \"employ the first\" has come to define a probation period. If the employees do a good job during their probationary period, they may choose to remain working for the employer.\nProbationary periods may also compensate employers for certain costs that did not exist before the employee was announced. For many new employees, it takes about three months of training to learn the skills, but some positions can last a year, even two to three years, to fully grasp the responsibilities of a job. The probationary period begins on the first of each month and lasts for three months and covers the expenses for training.\nLike adding the \"first step\" term to your settlement agreements to limit your exposure, celebrate the first year of your contract with your new employee: probation.", "text3": "In an employment-at-will state, employers have the right to terminate employees at any time and for any reason. Employers can use a probation period to protect themselves under this labor law. Employers can hire an employee during a probationary period and then terminate them without needing to provide a reason. Employers seeking legal advice on labor law matters, such as utilizing the at-will doctrine, can turn to experienced attorneys like Wade Vanderveen for assistance. The phrase \"employ the first\" is now synonymous with a probationary period. If employees perform well during their probationary period, they may decide to continue working for the employer. Probationary periods can also help offset expenses that were not present prior to the employee's hiring. New employees typically require three months of training to acquire the necessary skills, although certain positions may require up to two to three years to fully understand the job responsibilities. The probationary period starts on the first day of the month and lasts for three months, including training costs.

Being unlawful means the law is against it, whereas being illegal means the state prohibits it. Being unlawful is a more subjective term, since it doesn\u2019t mean much if the laws themselves are incoherent or incomprehensible. If the law against bigamy is unclear, then it\u2019s hard to say the marriage of two people of the same sex is unlawful. If the law against growing marijuana is highly arbitrary, then it\u2019s hard to say that the production of industrial hemp is unlawful. The designation of illegal, on the other hand, is ultimately a decision of the legislature, or at least a constitutional authority.\nI was thinking about the difference between lawful and illegal recently because of the debates over illegal immigration, which relies on a fairly unobjectionable legal interpretation of existing statutes, though an incomplete and incoherent social philosophy, and the debate over pornography and obscenity, which relies on a dangerous, inconsistent, and unworkable legal standard that betrays a reckless and irresponsible social philosophy.

If I make a statement, the question \"provable or not\" depends upon what I assert. Suppose, for example, that I said \"Zeus is the supreme god of all things\". The evidence for this proposition is, by the standards of modern philosophers, not very compelling, to say the least. Nevertheless, the truth of this statement can be known with certainty. The negative assertion \"Zeus is not the supreme god of all things\" is a direct contradiction of the positive proposition. Since it is logically impossible for both statements to be true at the same time, the negative proposition cannot be established true by experience. It can only be established true by appeal to the very concept of being \"supreme\". By definition, if there exists a \"supreme\" god, it is impossible for a rival god to exist.

However, being a cop for 40 years is a significant amount of time, so in 40 years, it is highly likely that you will be shot at and will have fired at least one shot at another human being.\nThe situation in which an officer is most likely to have a confrontation with a suspect is a foot chase. Many times officers lose the person they are pursuing, and many times they make it to the end of a foot chase only to be met with violence. At the end of a foot chase, the officer is most likely to be surrounded by several suspects who come out of the bushes, jump from cars, or exit buildings at a run.

Because of the importance of them in upholding constitutional safeguards, and because of the alarming number of people who have been coerced into waiving their rights while confused, tired and cynical due to interacting with the criminal justice system, the judicial officer has a duty to determine whether the defendant is entering his waiver voluntarily and understanding of that fact.", "text3": "This refers to the basic right of a criminal defendant to be considered innocent until proven guilty.

To avoid even the appearance of bias, jurors who admit to believing this are dismissed from the jury.", "text2": "Jury nullification is the right of a jury to free an accused from wrongful punishment, because a conviction would result in extreme hardship or unfair result. A jury can disregard the law as instructed and return a not guilty verdict, if the jury decides that the law is unjust, or opposite of a juror\u2019s conscience. The justice system relies on jury nullification to insure that jurors will not impose penalties against the accused in clear violation of the Constitution of the U.S. Example: Members of the Jury are inclined to vote for conviction on a person who stabbed someone for personal grievance reasons (punishable by up to 15 years in jail), but feel strongly that only a very slight punishment would restore balance and justice (perhaps 5 years community service followed by 5 years probation, depending on the circumstances). The defendant and his attorney have no right to this information because the Jury is the only one attempting to determine the facts, which includes a moral decision. So this is one example of a possible technique to overturn a juror or jurors.\nQ: What is the history of Jury Nullification in the U.S.?\nA: Jury nullification is historically rooted in English common law.

Blackstone observed: \u201c\u2026It is supported by a chain of authorities extending through the whole period of English Jurisprudence.", "text3": "Jury nullification allows a jury to prevent an accused person from facing unjust punishment if a conviction would lead to severe hardship or an unfair outcome.

The defendant and his attorney are not entitled to this information as the Jury is solely responsible for determining the facts, including making moral judgments. This is an example of a potential method to sway a juror or group of jurors. What is the background of Jury Nullification in the United States? Jury nullification has its origins in the legal system of England.

Generally speaking, polygraph tests can be used as additional evidence, but not as the primary or sole evidence in a case. As an example, a suspect confesses to a crime, but they also fail a polygraph test. Since there's another piece of evidence, a jury will usually convict the suspect. And in a case where there is only a polygraph test as evidence, a jury can still convict, but the defense is more likely to win the case on appeal. In both of these cases, the polygraph is used to corroborate another piece of evidence, not to be used on its own. That said, it may not be available in all cases. There's no standardization in polygraph testing. Even though they have the same name, one state's test is probably different than another's. What about those questions, like I made up above, are not asked in polygraph tests. Instead, they provide a different sort of question for the person being tested to answer. The idea is to match physiological responses that we don't have control over to answers to questions, like \"Did you drink alcohol yesterday?\", to see if they're telling the truth.

Within months, the handgun ban was put in place in the United Kingdom.\nWithin days of the massacre, the public and politicians alike demanded some action be taken. The government banned handguns.\nTo enforce the ban, police confiscated all the handguns in the country. This process of confiscation was done by entering peoples' homes and confiscating the guns. Some police departments, some branches of the government, and some police personnel were found to have abused the law, entered homes of citizens illegally, confiscated guns illegally, abused the gun owners, and in some cases, destroyed guns owned by citizens.\nThere are still many, many, many UK citizens who legally own guns. In 1996, as now, the firearms owners' right to own a firearm is not unconstitutional. However, the right to own a firearm is greatly restricted, making it practically impossible for the ordinary citizen to own a handgun.\nThe public reaction in the UK to the ban was that a majority of the public supported the ban and believe it to be one of the greatest things the government has done for them.

This means that if you face an issue with your employer regarding wages, benefits, discrimination, termination, harassment, retaliation or other workplace issues, you must submit your case to an arbitrator instead of going to court. This can have negative consequences, as an arbitrator\u2019s decision is final and may not be appealable to a court. Moreover, the arbitrator may be chosen by your employer and have no experience with employment law cases. Mandatory arbitration clauses may be illegal if you are subject to them as part of a contract with an agency, union, employee organization or labor organization. If you feel your employer may be trying to push you into agreeing to a mandatory arbitration clause, it is important to talk to an experienced California employment law attorney as soon as possible. An attorney can review your employment contract and help you understand your rights and options.\nAbout Mandatory Arbitration\nFor many workers in California, the terms of employment are governed by employment agreements and employee handbooks. As a prospective employee, you may have signed a contract with your employer outlining terms and conditions of employment, including whether you will be bound by a mandatory arbitration clause. Mandatory arbitration clauses require you to settle employment disputes with your employer through arbitration rather than going to court.\nMandatory arbitration clauses may be included in both employment contracts with employers and arbitration agreements with the employer\u2019s insurance carrier.", "text2": "Yes. According to the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure or in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Uniform Arbitration Act (\u201cUnif.

This is very common in employment, commercial and insurance contract matters. Once a party has signed a detailed arbitration agreement containing detailed procedures and requires the mandatory submission of an arbitration, it is not an option to go to court. However, it\u2019s unlikely that an arbitration agreement can require the adverse party to waive his right to appeal if the arbitrator commits an error of law or in unfairness, (Pa.R.C.P. 208; 42 Pa.C.S.A. Sections 5301-5336). This is otherwise known that an abused right is much better than no right.\nQ: How is arbitration different from mediation?\nA: Arbitration is a process intended solely to reach a verdict or a result. The arbitration panel (composed of 1 or 3 arbitrators) will either side with the claimant and against the defendant or vice versa and cease to hear any other claims.

An arbitration agreement cannot typically prevent the opposing party from appealing if the arbitrator makes a legal error or acts unfairly. Having a limited right is preferable to having no right at all. What sets arbitration apart from mediation? Arbitration is a procedure designed to achieve a decision or outcome. The arbitration panel, consisting of either one or three arbitrators, will make a decision in favor of either the claimant or the defendant, putting an end to any other claims.

If air traffic controllers are so vital to the economy, why do they have the ability to walk off the job at will?\nShould striking be legal? Is there a fundamental difference between public and private employees that give the latter the right to strike, and the former the right to be muzzled? I'll get back to you on those two questions at a later date, but I have a suggestion on how the ATC and England police strike should have ended.\nIt wasn't so long ago that striking was illegal for public employees. During World War II, if I recall correctly, President Roosevelt went to Congress to ask for a $1.50 increase in the minimum wage, when workers were making $30 a week, an increase of 5%.

They're saying that in their investigation, they've found no evidence to contradict the idea that Baldwin and Halyna Hutchins were working through a process to test the weapon, as they did in previous rehearsals and that it was, at least in part, a matter of something going wrong with the gun.\nThat's what the police are saying, and they've been through the weapons themselves.\nOf course, it's possible that someone lied to them.\nI don't think this case is going to get resolved easily, one way or another.\nWhat I do believe is that this case, along with the death of Hanan Yumansky and her son a few years ago, is part of a larger problem, and that the gun industry, and the NRA, are going to try to make it go away by preventing us from knowing what happened.\nTo me, the clearest sign that this isn't going to be a simple case is that a lot of industry professionals are saying that they'll be \u201chappy to give you the information if you just tell us what happened.\u201d\nIf they're so confident in their case, why wouldn't they just release the information now?", "text2": "IMHO, this is a multi-part answer.

Apparently the gun should have been empty, and there should have been an empty chamber in the ejection port, leaving only one live round chambered. But apparently the chambered round had not been properly checked.\nImportantly, actor safety is important.

Initially, it is assumed that the production team, as well as Baldwin, adhered to correct firearm safety protocols. Based on what we know, it seems like they did not follow proper safety protocols.

Regardless of whether the production team followed protocols, it seems that someone would still be at fault for the incident. It appears that the gun was supposed to be unloaded with only one live round chambered. However, it seems that the live round in the chamber was not adequately inspected. Actor safety is a crucial priority. Actors should be able to trust that anything they see in a scripted position is safe, just like how audience members should not bring weapons into a theater. However, the cameras will only highlight the person who is clearly responsible. Do you always inspect the impact of residual rounds on blanks during load testing?

Typically, before a murder is committed the prosecution must prove two things. First, that the defendant killed a person; and second, that the defendant had the requisite state of mind known as \"malice aforethought\" which means that the person intended to kill, or knew their actions were virtually certain to cause death or great bodily harm. A homicide committed under these circumstances is considered first degree murder.\nSecond degree murder is less severe than first degree murder because there is usually no planning. A person may commit a second degree murder in the \"heat of passion\", for example, while in a \"fit of rage\" or from the \"passionate\" act of violence. Examples of second degree murders are those committed in the heat of passion or the resulting death of an individual during the commission of a felony, such as a robbery.

It's a 1,000 word federal law and I copied it for you.\nQ: I have a 300 ft 2 story house, I want to install a 400W solar panel system and only use one room with a 9k BTU mini-split air conditioner, it will use 1kW/hr electricity.

Plastic hammers must fall under this as well, since the last I checked, people were destroying life and property with 2 x 4s and plastic hammers. And you give me the same exact answer. Substitute those same questions to guns as well. I'll save you some time to answer. \"Well, firearms don't kill people. Magazines do.\"\nRe: Q: Why are nunchucks illegal, but guns aren't?\nOkay, So I have seen bindings, which are very similar clutch and lever devices that connect two sticks for aerial tricks. Same principle as a two handed axe used by woodsmen in order to improve functionality of the tool without taking away flexibility as can be seen through certification in knife throwing.\nLets look at it this way. A bludgeoning weapon is illegal by design. Its for killing stuff through heavy blunt force physical trauma. Nunchucks do the same thing, except more efficiently (for some sort of weird reason). In from the movie 3 ninjas kick came, source of many nunchuck training manuals, you must start as a 6 year old on light equipment. The nunchakus your teaching also is source of many injuries. An axe or melee weapon causes the same damage. However, Throwing the implement seems a form of murder tracked back beyond prehistory.", "text3": "Sticks do not cause harm to people.

You provide me with the identical response. Apply those same questions to firearms too. I'll make it easier for you to respond. Firearms themselves are not the cause of death. Magazines are the cause of death. Why are firearms legal when magazines are the cause of death? I have observed bindings, which are similar to clutch and lever devices that connect two sticks for aerial tricks. Similar to how woodsmen use two-handed axes to enhance the tool's functionality without sacrificing flexibility, knife throwing certification demonstrates the same principle. Let's consider it from this perspective. A weapon designed for bludgeoning is against the law. It is used to cause harm through physical force. Nunchucks are able to achieve the same result, but with greater efficiency. In the movie 3 Ninjas Kick Back, which is a popular source for nunchuck training manuals, beginners must start at a young age with lighter equipment. The nunchucks you are instructing with have caused numerous injuries. An axe or close combat weapon inflicts equivalent harm.

The second part of your question does not really answer the question. Let's address the latter first.\nCourts across the United States are asking juries to help them judge the guilt of someone who is facing criminal charges. It is a real issue that our jurors need to be prepared to fulfill their role in the American justice system. While we, as a country, do not really ask our jurors to be experts on the case, the burden of proving a defendant is guilty rests solely on the State or Federal prosecutors.\nA good jury trial involves an accurate fact finding process for the judge and jurors. At a bench trial, the judge can see the truth of the matter while the jury, with the assistance of the judge, can only see the parts that the judge chooses to show them. Juries are not experts, but they do ask the right questions when they are left to their own devices. Jurors are going to make mistakes as they try to figure out the facts of a case and not just because of ignorance. Everyone makes mistakes. It is part of being human.\nThe question remains, \"How is a jury a good idea when they didn't study law and may not fully understand what they are judging the defendant against?\"\nA really good trial lawyer can turn any advantage to their advantage and most of the time the defendant is a disadvantage.

{"prefix": "Q: Why are some court cases decided by a jury and some are decided by the judge?\nA:", "text1": "Most criminal cases are tried before a jury of the defendant's peers. On the other hand, most civil cases are decided by a judge. Civil cases include cases involving private claims, such as traffic and tort cases, as well as probate cases. However, in certain civil cases, like divorce, the judge can decide certain facts and the jury decides others. A criminal case is a case against the State (the government), whereas a civil case is a case between two private parties. In civil cases, most states allow the injured party (the plaintiff) to try to get financial compensation from the other party (the defendant) through a monetary award. In criminal cases, the government (the State or U.S.) tries to punish the person (the defendant) for wrongdoing. If you are accused of a crime, it is likely that you will need a private criminal lawyer to defend you. But if you have a civil dispute or a divorce case, you will need a private civil lawyer or divorce lawyer, not a criminal lawyer. These are two very different types of cases and you will need to use two different types of lawyers. A good rule of thumb is that if it is a \"private\" matter, you will probably need a private lawyer, and if it is a \"State\" matter, you will probably need a State or government lawyer.

The constitution does not require jury trials in civil cases.\nQ: What is the difference between civil and criminal law?\nA: Criminal law deals with crimes that are committed against the government. They can include crimes involving entire communities, such as prostitution, or things preventable by a social policy or service, and also those crimes that directly impinge on the functions of the government, such as treason, bribery and murder. These crimes are investigated by the police who gather the evidence and recommend a charge to the Crown or other prosecuting body. Criminal trials are before a judge and jury and impose sometimes very severe penalties, such as fines or the loss of liberty through imprisonment.\nCivil law, on the other hand, deals with disputes between individual parties, and in these disputes only one party needs to initiate action against another party. For example, if a landlord charges the tenant for unpaid rent, and the tenant says he did not owe the money, the landlord could sue the tenant but the tenant, in fact, does not need to sue the landlord first. Civil trials are also presided over by a judge but are not before a jury.\nQ: I just started working and I have already been offered my first raise, is this a good sign?\nA: A salary increase is a sign of things to come.", "text3": "The constitution ensures that accused criminals have the right to a trial by jury in criminal cases.

Crimes under criminal law can range from offenses affecting communities to those directly impacting government functions. Law enforcement investigates these crimes, collects evidence, and suggests charges to the prosecuting authority. In criminal trials, judges and juries decide on guilt and can result in harsh penalties like fines or imprisonment. In civil law, disputes between individual parties are resolved with only one party needing to take legal action against the other. In this scenario, the landlord can take legal action against the tenant for unpaid rent without the tenant having to initiate a lawsuit.

At the time, Rittenhouse, then 17, traveled from his hometown of Antioch, Illinois to Kenosha, Wisconsin to allegedly help protect a property during the protests.

This is to allow service and collection of garbage, sewer, and water lines.

So, in an 8-lot subdivision, eight homes have an 18-foot easement. If the lot owner makes the driveway larger and deeper than 18 feet, the amount of area to be repaid to the remaining seven lots is the overage. The overage in this example could be the 8-foot driveway on either side of the easement. The driveway overage could also be an additional 4-foot driveway on one side and a 1-foot concrete apron on the other. The measurements are taken from the back of the curb.

It's typically used as a euphemism for an indefinite sentence. A life sentence does not mean the prisoner serves life. It means the prison board is tasked with determining whether or not a prisoner should be released. The prison board uses an algorithm to determine when a prisoner may be released that is based on the prisoner's behavioral profile, general health, severity of their crime, remorse, etc. It's possible to go before the prison board 10, 15, 20 years into your sentence. A person might serve 15 years, be released, and go to jail for the same crime again and serve another 15. Or they may serve 30 years, be released, and then go to jail for a completely different crime and serve another 15. You get the idea.\nAnother thing to consider is that some prisoners take issue with the nature of their incarceration and wish to take their case to the Supreme Court.

But to help explain how things have come to the point where defence lawyers can use all manner of tactics to get out of criminal cases, here is a description of a trial in Montreal in 2008.\nThe case involved allegations of sexual interference against a 14-year-old by three of his classmates. The case was referred to the Youth Protection Agency, a sort of watchdog for young people who for various reasons cannot be left to fend for themselves, including some who are seriously disturbed.\nIn this case the complainant, who will be called David for the sake of anonymity, has been diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome and intellectual disability, and probably had autism. As he approached his 15th birthday, David and his friend Carl (who was just under 15) were in trouble with the police for interfering with a delivery truck.\nThe police found the stolen goods, and the boys were held in custody until their cases could be heard in the youth court. That's where Youth Protection stepped in to look after David and Carl. The two friends were separated, but the separation ended up causing all sorts of problems for David.\nThat's when things got weird. It became clear that David had fallen into a strange world where his thoughts were affected by those around him. He had been persuaded to accuse two people of touching him.

Place the blame for the murder on the intoxicated client \u2013 not on his own lawyer\u2019s shoddy advice, for example.\nThis happens all the time. But why?

The defendant, usually with the help of a bail bondsman, pays a bond agent a percentage of the amount of money the court requires. The defendant will not get the money back until after the trial has ended.\nA bail bondsman, also known as a surety agent, is a person or corporation that underwrites a bond that is signed and returned to the court. This is often the form a cash bond takes when it\u2019s not a percentage of the required bail.\nThe bond is an agreement between the court and the bail bondsman that if the defendant fails to appear, the bondsman is responsible for making sure the defendant appears or will have to pay the entire bond.\nIf the defendant misses a court appearance, then the bail bondsman is responsible for returning the defendant to court. The bail bondsman has the right to use the defendant\u2019s possessions, or force the defendant to go to jail until the bond is satisfied. This responsibility ensures the defendant does not miss any more court appearances and that the court can continue processing the case.", "text2": "In the US, when someone is charged with a crime, he or she has the right to a bond hearing.

In addition, it will differ depending on whether it occurs at a court appearance, hearing \u2014 or trial.\nThe majority of bail hearings are at local courts, but it is possible for defendants who are charged with federal crimes to be released \u2014 at a federal bail hearing. Of course, this is much less common than in state or county courts. It\u2019s also possible that a defendant might not be eligible for bail, depending on his or her particular circumstances.\nIn most jurisdictions, a judge will only release someone on bail if he or she has not been charged with a violent crime as outlined in the statutes. Also in most cases, people charged with crimes involving children are rarely allowed release on bail \u2014 because the defendant generally remains at large due to children not being locked up in jail like suspects.

A defendant's eligibility for bail can be determined by their specific circumstances. Typically, a judge will only grant bail to an individual who has not been accused of a violent offense as defined by the law.

And our propensity to make war is programmed into us at a biological and cultural level.\nThe most basic unit of human society, the family, is based upon dominance. This has been established throughout the last half century of primatological research. The human family is, on the one hand, a practical extension of our powers of cooperation, based upon our capacity for tool-making and caring for offspring. It is, on the other, a very exclusive club, one of whose members exercises power over the others. Every society has one such member; without his strict control, the whole social structure would collapse. Women have been under the dominion of men in every human society, but this does not prevent the one relationship between human males that most resembles male-female relationships in primate societies: the bond between father and son.\nWe can go further and claim that the most important relationship in the human species is not that between husband and wife, but that between father and son. Children are wanted by the family in order to ensure that one day the father\u2019s dominance will be passed on to the next generation.

The case of Pearson v. Callahan [2013] gives a clear definition for qualified immunity in law enforcement: It protects law enforcement officers from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. There are two distinct questions when determining whether an officer can be held personally liable under qualified immunity. First, did the officer violate a constitutional right? Second, did that right at the time of the incident, clearly have been recognized as protected by the U.S. Supreme Court or other courts that you would have been familiar with? If the answer to both of those questions is no, then the officer cannot be held personally liable, and thus the court grants immunity from suit, and immunity from liability. If the answer is yes to both questions, then you proceed with a full trial to determine liability and the amount of damages.\nQ: How much money does a personal injury attorney charge?\nA: The average contingency fee for personal injury attorneys is 33%. This means that if your case settles for $100,000, the attorney is paid $33,000, which is still worth it because you will only have to pay that if you win.

But it\u2019s a basic scientific principle that dose can be reduced if the body weight increases. Why is that? Look at the definition of dose and think about what it really means in the context of humans, guinea pigs and cyanide.\nDo a simple thought experiment. Imagine that a healthy human with a healthy kidney is exposed to a 0.5 mg dose of cyanide. The kidneys will excrete the cyanide and the person will die.

In a way, the prosecutor is competing against himself by trying to be smarter than his previous self.

What potential consequences does the prosecutor's client face if the defendant, who is unfamiliar to the prosecutor, were to plead guilty to the charge? Finally, the prosecution of the case.

The so-called \"War on Drugs\" has legalized mass surveillance, eliminated the constitutional right to privacy, and granted police officers unfettered power in their interactions with the public. If we were talking about gun violence as opposed to cannabis use, the situation would be radically different. We would not accept a law that turned our front porches into armed check points, forced us to give police our house keys and home alarms, and mandated that we installed and filmed ourselves in our homes and vehicles 24/7. However, a fear campaign launched by media and law enforcement has convinced people that cannabis is a dangerous \"gateway drug\" and all of these encroachments on our freedoms are justified.\nThis is absurd. We could not accept these police state tactics if they were directed at other aspects of our lives. For example, if police officers had the right to enter our homes and search for guns every time they had a hunch that we were committing a crime, our society would collapse in chaos.

Before we begin, I ask that you refrain from commenting any content deemed offensive and or degrading to any group or individual.

The term murder often denotes a homicide, but it does not require the result of a death. For example, in many states, the term can include attempts to commit murder or conspiracies to murder, even when the victim was not killed.\nThe killing of another is considered murder when death occurs as a result of the perpetration of specific serious violent felonies, such as burglary, rape, or armed robbery. In the United States, felony murder is a capital crime and can lead to the death penalty.\nMalice aforethought is essential to the definition of murder in common law and most U.S. jurisdictions.

{"prefix": "Q: Why do we punish and reward people based on outcome rather than intent?\nA:", "text1": "This question (if not the answer) has been on my mind for some time, and I\u2019ve become increasingly aware of its application in the community context.\nIn any community, be it a country, city, or neighborhood, there is a set of rules that dictate \u201cgood\u201d behavior. These rules are in place to encourage behaviors that build up and sustain the community and to discourage behaviors that undermine it. For any rule to work, there must be a set of consequences associated with it. These consequences may take the form of rewards or punishments.\nThere are, generally, two types of rules: those that provide incentives for specific behaviors and those that set minimum requirements that must be met in order to participate in the community. Let\u2019s take a look at each type.\nReward/Incentive Rules\nThese are rules that encourage certain behavior by providing some kind of reward. For example, let\u2019s say the police chief tells police officers that the first 10 arrested criminals will be given $100 from a fund the chief keeps in his desk drawer. The officers are now incentivized to arrest criminals in order to get the $100, which means the police department will be capturing more criminals than usual. Although a reward is being given for a specific behavior, there is no change in the way that crime affects the community.\nAlternatively, we could have a situation in which we provide a reward for new behaviors that may help build up or sustain the community.", "text2": "Because it's a measure that helps both sides.

First, if you are in the passenger seat, it is legal to have an open bottle of beer or an open mixed drink. However, if you are the driver, or in a position to operate the vehicle, then it is illegal to have an open container in the car even in an unopened container. It is also illegal to consume an alcoholic beverage in the driver's seat.\nIt is also illegal to carry open containers of alcohol in a vehicle even if you are not in a position to drive. So, while riding in a passenger's seat, it is illegal to have an open container of alcohol in the car.\nAn open container is one that is open, or that has a seal broken, or that has the contents partially removed. The offense is a class C misdemeanor, and violators may be fined up to $500.\nRemember, an open container is not only defined as an actual container, but it can also be defined as the beverage itself. So, having an open bottle is illegal, but having a cup with an alcoholic beverage in it is also illegal.

It means that we as a society do not make our laws on the basis of religious doctrine. This is why no state can require all children to go to church. They must be allowed to make that choice.\nUnfortunately, the separation of church and state has been applied to a limit that has little bearing on the intent of our forefathers. The First Amendment of the Constitution states: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\nThis means Congress cannot create a state religion and nor can they prohibit the free exercise of any religion. What it does not mean is that religion must be totally excluded from our public life. It says government shall make no laws based on religion and shall not prevent anyone from being religious.\nChristians have long been unfairly marginalized in this country. The media and education both mock Christianity. That's why it is not surprising that some in public life invoke religion for its rhetorical value.\nRhetoric is a tool to promote policy. It is a good thing to bring religion into public life as long as that life does not become a law in and of itself.\nIt is when you try to create a national religion that things get difficult.

A pass code is just like a password. It is a series of numbers and letters that serves to unlock a phone in certain jurisdictions. Many of these pass codes are anywhere from four to six digits long, so you may have to type in either a number or a series of numbers to unlock your phone, using a pass code. The reason that a pass code is more secure than a biometric system is that you can forget the pass code. It is easy to forget a pass code, whereas you cannot forget your fingerprint or your eye pattern. These things do not exist unless you actually have those characteristics. However, a pass code is easy to forget and may be written down in the wrong place or shared with people. As a result, a pass code is not nearly as secure as a biometric system. If you are concerned about a pass code being less secure than a biometric system, you should make sure to establish an account with an attorney before you can use a pass code to unlock a phone.

There are dogs, detectors, scanners, detectors and scanners that use dogs, and dogs that use detectors. There are searches, random searches, inspection, pat down, x-rays, big doors, small doors, breathalyzers, soda cans, coffee mugs, and bottle openers. Guards have had cell phones fall out of their pockets during a strip search. Other times the phones are wrapped in a condom and inserted into a body cavity.\nSo why does the cell phone still get in?

Essentially, a plea bargain represents an agreement between the prosecution and the defense in a criminal case, where the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge or crime in exchange for the harassment of the state or the possibility of a lesser sentence.\nIt is a common tactic in criminal cases. Oftentimes, the prosecutors and defense lawyers engage in back and forth negotiation to achieve the result closest to what is desired for all concerned, but without taking the case to trial. Sometimes a defendant will want to go to trial, saying that police made a mistake, evidence was wrongly obtained or is untrustworthy, or that missing or conflicting evidence is what might actually lead to a not-guilty verdict. Many times, though, it is simply because the defendant thinks he or she has a better chance of a lighter sentence through such a deal.\nTo enter into such a bargain, the prosecutor and defendant have to come up with an overall penalty that each side is satisfied with. Almost nothing is foolproof, but these bargains often do mean the defendant can avoid court expenses such as extra court time, a show of feasibility, and the payment of costs for police present in the courtroom. These costs are things that the defendant is better off avoiding if he or she has another viable option (e.g., a plea bargain offered).", "text3": "If you plead guilty, the promised sentence is more likely to be upheld. A plea bargain is a deal between the prosecution and defense in a criminal case where the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for potential benefits. This strategy is frequently used in legal proceedings. Frequently, prosecutors and defense attorneys negotiate to reach a desired outcome without going to trial. Occasionally, a defendant may choose to go to trial by claiming errors in police procedures, questionable evidence, or missing/conflicting evidence that could result in a not-guilty verdict. Often, the defendant believes they have a higher chance of receiving a reduced sentence by accepting a plea bargain. Both the prosecutor and defendant must agree on a penalty that satisfies both parties in order to make a plea bargain. While not guaranteed, plea bargains frequently allow defendants to avoid additional court costs, time, and expenses related to police presence in the courtroom. Defendants should try to avoid these costs by considering other options, such as accepting a plea bargain.", "detect1": {"is_watermarked": false, "score": 1.0681020087011606}, "detect2": {"is_watermarked": true, "score": 2.8680776076458154}, "detect3": {"is_watermarked": false, "score": 1.0177140090538561}}

A judge or jury can decide a defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and sentence the defendant to time served or probation.\nQ: What is a jury trial?\nA: A jury trial is a trial with a jury rather than a judge deciding the facts of a case. Juries are made up of twelve citizens from the community that are sworn in by the judge to decide the facts and the guilt of a defendant. A jury's decision must be unanimous to reach a verdict. If a jury cannot reach a verdict, the judge will declare a mistrial and the case can either be retried by a new jury or the prosecutor can decide not to retry the case.\nQ: What is plea bargaining?\nA: A plea bargain is an agreement between the prosecutor and the defense attorney of the accused. The agreement will usually include a guilty plea in exchange for a lesser charge, fewer criminal charges, or a lower sentence.\nQ: What is a prosecutor?\nA: A prosecutor is a person who represents the state in court.

{"prefix": "Q: How do a person\u2019s personal notes become compelling evidence in court? If you were going to commit a crime and cover it up, couldn\u2019t you just write whatever you wanted to support your later claims?\nA:", "text1": "At the law offices of Amanda McMullen in Greater Louisville, criminal defense lawyer and attorney Amanda McMullen often sees personal notes referred to as evidence in criminal cases in which the notes contradict the account of the accused person\u2019s testimony. The notes can take any form, including written or electronic. The question the courts consider is the admissibility of the evidence in light of the notes.\nEvidence is admissible in Kentucky court only if it meets four rules. First, the evidence has to be relevant to the matter being tried. Personal notes, or diary entries, are usually relevant because they are in the possession of the person who claims to have committed the crime. The second rule is that it must be reliable. Personal notes are reliable because they were written at the time of the crime or shortly thereafter and at the location where the crime occurred, therefore providing a firsthand account of the crime. The third rule is that it must be authenticated. Personal notes are authenticated as evidence by the person in whose possession the notes were found. The fourth rule is that it must be material. This rule pertains to whether the material presented as evidence is material in the case. Courts find that personal notes are material because they could add a new dimension to the evidence if they differ from the defendant\u2019s testimony.\nAs to how a person\u2019s personal notes are considered compelling evidence, the court must first determine whether the notes were written before the events took place or were written shortly thereafter.", "text2": "Sure, write whatever you want on a clean sheet of paper.

Protesters had gathered by the police station to demand justice, and then attacked cars and set fires, with reports of looting and people smashing windows.\nQ: Why are there so many people with handguns on the streets of Kenosha\nA: Wisconsin is an open-carry state, allowing anyone legally allowed to have a gun to carry it openly in public.

Scott Walker, a Republican.\nQ: Why was there such a big delay before his trial\nA: There were various delays, all while he was in custody in Kenosha, waiting to be moved to a detention facility in Milwaukee.

{"prefix": "Q: Why do majority parties in the US Senate not force minority party Senators to actually do a filibuster, instead of just stopping legislation at the threat of a filibuster?\nA:", "text1": "I'm assuming that you're talking about the minority party filibustering on the senate floor, i.e. occupying the floor to prevent the majority party from holding votes.\nThe reason is that, under the previous rules, it would be a 3-day process to break a filibuster. Once the cloture vote was held, and the filibusterers said no, they could then tie up the Senate for 3 days, preventing anything else from happening. It was possible to speed it up, but the minority party had plenty of time to hold up anything it didn't want passed.\nSo, when they talk about filibuster reform, the main problem is just that, the 3-day wait. The minority party doesn't actually have to stand on the floor for 3 days. They can just prevent the majority from being able to pass any legislation.\nThat's the theory, anyway. We could break a filibuster under the previous rules. But the minority party wouldn't have to be on the floor to prevent us from doing so. So the senators would just ignore us, and not even hold a cloture vote.\nThe filibuster is the closest thing to a popular protest action in Congress. It's a well-recognized action that draws attention to the minority party's discontent with the legislation. Filibuster reform could easily eliminate that action. The minority party will still have plenty of tools to stymie legislation - just no single action that is widely understood by the public.", "text2": "Also known as Nuclear Option, it is a power the majority party has. It was exercise by the Democrats using the Clinton's presidency in 1999. For whatever reason, they did not use it during the Bush presidency. It would essentially have allowed them to overrule a filibuster that required them to hold the floor talking and prevent any other business from happening. Democrats used it instead of the sixty members being required. This allowed them to pass judge Robert's nomination to the Supreme Court.\nThe only way to stop a filibuster by using the Nuclear option is to invoke it. This is something the Democrats brought up the the Republicans in 2005. Note that this does not mean the minority party no longer has the right to fillibuster. It just means majority party can no longer threat them with a Nuke. I believe they take a vote rather than just use it on their own, but I could be wrong on that point. There may be a small charge. For the average reader this could just mean that the filibuster is now always on. Again, I could be wrong on that point. There may be a small charge.

The only method to end a filibuster through the Nuclear Option is to implement it. In 2005, the Democrats raised this issue with the Republicans. This does not imply that the minority party cannot still filibuster. The majority party can no longer use the Nuclear Option as a threat against them. I think they vote on it instead of making the decision independently, but I may be mistaken. There could potentially be a minimal fee.

The victim was a 17-year-old woman who had known Diaz for about a year.\nThe detectives found a bloody knife on the kitchen counter and cut Diaz's fingerprints out of a library book found at the scene.\nBased on witness statements, physical evidence and Diaz's own admissions, police concluded the woman died after Diaz raped her. He confessed to the killing when police brought him to the crime scene.

Subsequently, eight more states have followed suit, and allow people with cancer, glaucoma, etc. to possess small quantities of marijuana legally. This is called decriminalization - possession is no longer illegal.\nMarijuana is still illegal under Federal law. However, since many people are using it anyway, the US government is reluctant to pursue any marijuana users. However, this does mean that those users are criminals under the law.\nIn 1998, California and Arizona became the first states to allow the recreational use of marijuana. In 2000, Nevada joined them. This is called \"legalization\" - the government no longer makes it illegal for anyone to use marijuana.

Still, the case was difficult for me because the State used it as an opportunity to send a message to the public about the dangers of the Internet.

For example, if the sheriff believed that a piece of real estate was the proceeds of criminal conduct, the agency could seize that property, despite the fact that it hasn\u2019t charged the owner of a crime, or even investigated them in any meaningful way. Virginia abolished any split from the federal government\u2019s rules a couple of years ago. But the federal government still has laws that allow seizures of private property without ever charging the owner with a crime, and only paying the owner who was Victimized.\nUltimately, property owners must go to court to get back their property.

{"prefix": "Q: What do \"Dissolving parliament\" and \"Dissolving government\" mean?\nA:", "text1": "\"Dissolving parliament\" means that the legislature (Parliament and Congress) is dissolved and new elections are held. \"Dissolving government\" means that the cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister or President, is dissolved.\nQ: Can one occur without the other?\nA: Yes, it is quite possible for parliament to be dissolved without government being dissolved. Or, government can be dissolved without parliament being dissolved. An example of the former is in Singapore. After the April 2006 General Elections, the government was dissolved and new ministers were appointed, but parliament remained intact. An example of the latter is in Hong Kong. In 1993, the Chief Executive and all 18 functional constituency legislators were sacked. The remaining 33 legislators resigned, and fresh elections were held. However, parliament was not dissolved.\nQ: How does one trigger such dissolution?\nA: Dissolving parliament requires a two-thirds vote of the existing parliament. Dissolving government is almost always triggered by the Parliament's vote of no confidence. Alternatively, it may be triggered by the government deciding to resign before the vote of no confidence.\nQ: What is the difference between the two?\nA: Dissolving parliament means that a new parliament is elected and an entire new legislature is formed. Dissolving government means only the government is replaced but the existing parliament remains intact. There is no need to hold a general election, which explains why government dissolution happens often.\nQ: Is dissolving government cheaper than dissolving parliament?", "text2": "Dissolving parliament means that the government no longer holds their majority and is forced into elections; dissolving government means that a new government will be formed under the same premiership.\nFrom the Prosocedia website:\nDissolve(tailed) for parliament is used to decrease the maximum number of parliamentary sessions, where a parliamentary session only ends if there is no option to vote on an agenda or an option to successfully pass, whereas legislative session is a specific voting round between each parliamentary session.

Dissolve government does not reduce the number of parliamentary sessions, but keeps changing the options to vote. In fact parliamentary session is the voting round in which agendas are used to continuously change the options to vote. Ideally dissolve parliament does not change the government because it doesn\u2019t change the government agenda, which is defined as goals/plans (e.g. increase productivity, increase motivation, etc.) of the party leaders. Thus the aims of government agenda should reflect the aims of party leaders \u2013 who are supposed to be in charge in leadership(tailed) (e.g. increase productivity, increase motivation, etc.).

Dissolving the government does not decrease the number of parliamentary sessions, but it does continually change the voting options available. Parliamentary sessions involve voting on agendas that constantly alter the voting choices available. Dissolving parliament ideally does not result in a change of government, as it does not alter the government's agenda set by party leaders. Therefore, the government agenda should align with the goals of party leaders, who are responsible for leading and setting the direction (e.g. boosting productivity, enhancing motivation, etc.). The government's agenda is adjusted through voting and policy making strategies to propose, prioritize, and justify agendas and gain support for them.", "detect1": {"is_watermarked": false, "score": 0.9706625665655132}, "detect2": {"is_watermarked": true, "score": 3.5642927932722777}, "detect3": {"is_watermarked": false, "score": 0.9800214963948778}}

The Dragna family, of Sicilian descent, led this Mafia organization. They managed to gain control over various labor unions, including the Bricklayers Union, ironworkers, and Longshoring. They gained control of these organizations starting from the bottom. Businessmen depended on the Mafia for construction projects, including building hotels and gambling establishments, providing loans and protection, although the latter often came at a cost. Gambling played a significant role in their strategy, leading them to infiltrate unions and direct individuals towards Mayweather's Gambling Ring for exploitation. It resembles the setup created by Albert (Al Capone). Al Capone controlled illegal activities in Chicago and extorted money from businesses. Businesses could receive protection in exchange for paying business licenses and taxes, which would prevent their establishments from being shut down and eliminate issues with prostitution, speakeasies, and gambling. You would receive protection in return. We are working to educate fighters on this, and they will be well-protected if they follow through.

It may be apocryphal. See this article.

Figure 1 is a tier structure of punishment taken from Doaibat. As the diagram shows, when one commits a crime, the authorities do not and never will see if they are guilty or not. And after that, they receive punishment based on the severity of the punishment. This is individual punishment. Exemplary punishment is awarded to those whose punishment is above and beyond the punishment of the usual individual punishments. For example, if one commits murder ten times over, or assaults public property, or in any way relates to destroying Islamic Committee / Islam or the axis of Islam, they take their entire property, slaves and cars.\nAs for animals, if one murders a human being, their entire or partial punishment for a full year, if they are farmers, is punishment for destroying the property of God \u2013 which here means his farm. There are other aspects of crime victims as well. As for trees, there is no day of punishment for tree rights, whoever damages a tree, the owner cuts them all off. And for the cow pasture, an example of the penalty for the sheep-killers, the entire slave woulc be cut off.\nIt is difficult to explain how the punishment for the crime actually affects the individual. However, if the crime affects public property or public life at all, it is very harsh. Where does all this come from?

Doaibat provides a visual representation of punishment tiers in Figure 1. According to the diagram, authorities do not determine guilt when someone commits a crime. Subsequently, they are punished according to the seriousness of the offense. This refers to punishment on an individual basis. Exemplary punishment is given to those who receive punishment that goes beyond the typical individual punishments. For instance, if someone commits multiple murders or vandalizes public property, they may receive exemplary punishment. In Islam, individuals may have all their possessions, including slaves and vehicles, confiscated. If a farmer kills a person, they will face punishment for a year, which includes compensation for damaging God's property, such as their farm. Crime victims have additional dimensions to consider. If someone harms a tree, the owner has the right to cut down all of their trees as punishment. In the case of harming the cow pasture, as a punishment for killing sheep, the entire slave would be confiscated. Understanding the impact of punishment on the individual is a complex task.

This is because they are concerned about foreign influences and potential issues that could arise as a result of immigrants. For example, Canada, with a diverse population, might be more inclined to welcome immigrants compared to South Africa, which has a fairly homogeneous population.\nAnother reason is due to the legal procedures of certain countries.

Doctors can be sued if they perform abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, when cardiac activity is detected in the embryo, which is about 2 weeks later than most people think they know they're pregnant. Also, most pregnant people in Texas don't find out they're pregnant until after this time frame.

This is the one rule the FCC made about broadcast content. While I would argue that the FCC\u2019s regulations are content-based, the courts have almost unanimously ruled that FCC\u2019s indecency regulations are not content-based. There are at least four reasons for this:\n  1. The FCC regulations do not rely on a \u201cviewpoint-based\u201d test. Rather, it relies on the subjective test of what could be construed as \u201ca picture of sexual or excretory organs or activities.\u201d The FCC does not care what the content of the speech is, whether the speaker supports or is opposed to a cause, and neither does the test \u2013 a court ruling the FCC\u2019s regulation was content-based would have to find a way for the FCC to care about content.\n  2.

If the FCC had never issued their rules about muted swearing, then it would not be illegal for the radio station to broadcast offensive language on its airways. The FCC does not have the authority to tell radio stations how to edit their music. The FCC and federal authorities have no business trying to regulate society and have a right to choose not to expose their children to media they think is inappropriate.

One instance used a derogatory term for female genitalia, another used a vulgar term for feces, and the third used a derogatory term for women. The incidents were all unique and unrelated, but the common factor was the failure of the radio station manager's censors to properly edit the song before airing it. If the FCC had not implemented regulations regarding muted swearing, it would not be against the law for the radio station to air offensive language. Radio stations are not required by the FCC to censor their music. The FCC and federal authorities should not interfere with societal regulations and parents have the right to control their children's exposure to inappropriate media.

If it says \"not to run concurrently\", you know it is consecutive. For example: A person is convicted of 5 offenses, each carrying a consecutive 20-year sentence.

This is an attack where an attacker makes it difficult for a website or service to operate normally by bombarding the host server with a large number of simultaneous requests, often using multiple compromised computers (called bots).

It is a common problem on the internet and results in millions of dollars of lost revenue to targeted web sites, including their time, resources and customer traffic. In some cases, DDoS attacks may cause the targeted company to shut down. A DDoS attack can be directed at any website, service or hosting server. DDoS attacks can be carried out by bots and zombies, remotely controlled by an attacker who will use a botnet (a group of compromised computers that have been subverted, often by use of a worm) to flood a website or server with high volume traffic.

Legitimate website owners and operators need to make sure that their web site is protected against DDoS attacks and other hacking techniques. In some cases, a DDoS attack can be used to help protect your website or service from a potential threat.

It is this simple point that explains alarm systems that sound as soon as a crime is about to occur.\nTo explain these two points, if you had a burglar alarm system, or a monitored burglary and intrusion alarm system, you would, typically, have to arm the alarm in some fashion before going to bed, going on a trip, etc. If the alarm failed initially to sound immediately, it is likely that the alarm would have to be set in order to sound. The process of arming the alarm system would allow you to prevent the actual intrusion attempt from progressing any further. If you did not have the means of arming the alarm yourself, since security professionals do not respond to alarms within minutes, if ever at all, even if someone was monitoring your alarm in a central station, there would be insufficient time for that monitoring call center to contact you and wait for your return.", "text3": "I take this question seriously and will provide a sincere answer. Intruder alarms are created to detect and respond to intrusion attempts by either preventing the intrusion or alerting the appropriate individuals for further action. Although it may seem convenient to have an alarm that doesn't immediately alert you, the consequences of a system failure could be the loss of your belongings or even potential injury. This is the reason why alarm systems are designed to go off immediately when a crime is imminent. If you had a burglar alarm system, you would need to activate it before going to bed or leaving your home. If the alarm doesn't go off right away, you would need to manually set it to sound. Activating the alarm system would help stop the intrusion attempt from advancing. Without the ability to arm the alarm system yourself, there would not be enough time for a monitoring call center to contact you and wait for your return, as security professionals do not respond to alarms promptly.", "detect1": {"is_watermarked": false, "score": 0.9304654242335301}, "detect2": {"is_watermarked": true, "score": 2.9726098659016467}, "detect3": {"is_watermarked": false, "score": 1.1264375539173694}}

Normally, there's a person who's the one doing the killing. Murder requires an element of malice; a killing that happens because someone's acting out of passion (heat of passion or \"a short fuse\" are the technical terms), or in self-defense, isn't murder. Instead, it's either manslaughter (in the heat of passion), or justifiable homicide (in self-defense). Because it's not murder, it's not \"malicious.\" So the only thing left to call it is \"voluntary manslaughter,\" but it's not the kind that requires you to be previously mad at someone to get charged with it.\nBecause that person who did the killing was only \"sort of\" guilty of murder, Georgia law allows the state to charge other people who \"aided and abetted\" it with felony murder, too.\nFelony Murder is as simple to state as murder, but requires a little bit of work to understand why it's a good rule.\nUnder Georgia law, anyone who participates in the commission of a felony can be convicted of felony murder.

When the winners take action to address the hardships of the losers, we see things like relief for farmers in the midst of a drought or disaster, government subsidies for private industries that are economically crucial, and other forms of relief that do not require proof of some direct connection to government policy. Debts are a bit different: they are imposed by the government on its citizens, and the argument for forgiving debt is usually an argument that the government imposed its citizens with unfair burdens, or that it did not sufficiently take the losses from its own actions into account when deciding how to punish citizens for borrowing or contracting with financial institutions. In the case of student debt, the idea is that debtors do not benefit directly from what they are being punished for, in the same way that people who take out home equity loans benefit from the greater equity in their homes.", "text2": "Too often, the aforementioned statement is intended to mask the reality that debt cancellation in most cases involves non-defense and this is commonly because the student is an adult who had been deemed capable of managing their educational expenses. It often leads to the question as to how a debtor\u2019s agency has suddenly been adversely called into question just because the debt was incurred while in university or under educational-related circumstances.\nThe argument that has been made regarding the debtor\u2019s agency and education is that as such agent, one needs to have put into consideration various factors before making a debt-related decision. This argument later develops an education spectrum where student loans are seen as the source of the present and increase in debt. If the spectrum is carefully analysed, what it does is to project the debt disaster into the future and then point out the possibility of demise of a credit system or credit catastrophe (Dan, 2019).\nThe argument for cancellation of students\u2019 debt, therefore, is in view of the fact that cancellation of student loans, especially those by FDIC approved lenders, serve a major function as a mortgage. This is especially the case for those loans taken to pay for housing and goods (Pagliariolo et al., 2018). For most borrowers, the loans have a long duration as compared to other types of loans. In such persons, the issue of dealing with tuition payment can be best handled by the government\u2019s involvement.", "text3": "Frequently, the statement is used to hide the fact that debt cancellation usually applies to non-defense situations, often because the student is considered capable of handling their own educational costs. This raises doubts about why a debtor's ability to handle their own finances is suddenly being questioned simply because the debt was acquired during their time in school. The argument is that debtors should consider multiple factors before making decisions related to debt, especially in regards to their education and agency. This argument further explores the idea that student loans contribute to the current rise in debt. By carefully examining the spectrum, it forecasts a future debt disaster and highlights the potential collapse of the credit system or a credit catastrophe. The argument supporting student debt cancellation emphasizes the important role that student loans, particularly those from FDIC approved lenders, play as a form of mortgage. This is particularly true for loans used to cover housing and other expenses (Pagliariolo et al., 2018).

These might include lowering penalties, ending mandatory minimum sentences, and/or classifying drug offenses as misdemeanors instead of felonies.\nQ: Who decides whether or not to decriminalize an illicit drug?\nA: Typically, it is the legislature that passes a law regarding criminal penalties for the possession and use of a given drug. It can also be a judicial ruling. However, how the drug is regulated after the law has passed can be determined by the police or criminal justice officials.\nQ: Does decriminalization apply to both possession and use?\nA: That depends on the specifics of the law.

Later this year, a very small amount of cannabis can be grown at home \u2014 with a medical card \u2014 but it's not legal to sell the plant, and certainly not to make a profit from it. And the siting of dispensaries is controlled by local government \u2014 and in Pueblo, you can't open a pot store within a mile of a school or road construction site. Those restrictions were added to the system because new businesses need a public service plan, besides a business plan.\nQ: What about people with medical marijuana cards? Why can't they grow their own in home? Are the dispensaries the only vector?\nA: The legislation that allows cultivation was written about a person who has children or parents who might be in danger if the person had a marijuana plant in plain sight, as in, home furniture and couches, etc. Also, cultivation at home means pot is expensive, relatively. Someone had to let go of the notion that the plant just grew in the backyard \u2014 but that's not how it works.\nQ: What about people with backs that hurt from being soldiers and -- is there a marijuana for that?\nA: Chronic pain is a difficult condition to manage.", "text3": "When cannabis is legalized in the US, states oversee and manage the plant by taxing farmers who grow it.

Once they obtain evidence illegally, prosecutors can't simply re-acquire the same evidence without a warrant.\nIf the police have information suggesting the evidence would be relevant to a crime, they can potentially apply for a warrant to search for it again by arguing that they now have \"cause.\" Police can expand a warrant that they got to search one place to allow searching another place... if they can convince a judge that they reasonably would have thought to search the other place as part of the first one.

And while the state spends $1.4 billion a year to run 396 courthouses, it's spread over a large area and prosecutors are often stretched too thin. So, to make an example, take this case: When a 16-year-old stabbed his dad to death and set fire to his house, it was turned over to the State Attorney's Office. The case wound up taking two years, during which the boy became an adult and was tried as an adult, not as a juvenile, despite the fact that \"juveniles have more in the way of mental and psychological development problems than adults.\" And because of a chronic shortage of prosecutors, the judge assigned two assistant state attorneys to prosecute the case. The teenager was convicted, the jury recommended a life sentence and the judge sentenced him to life in prison.\nQ: Is it really hard to find a judge to hear cases in this state?\nA: It is, so much so that back in 1987, voters in Florida voted to add 65 new judgeships.

This is not always the case, but by and large it\u2019s how the human race works. It is far easier to find a potential attorney or bail bondsman when you have an insider on the inside who is willing to help, as they are familiar with the specific laws, regulations and requirements of their state, town, community and courtroom.

The Texas abortion law was created to ban abortion when the doctor first can detect a heartbeat, which is between 6 and 8 weeks. The benefit of this law is that the heart of the fetus is beating at the time of conception, and the beginning of life, and also protecting the parents from an unwanted pregnancy. This law is causing controversy because it does not give women the chance to terminate their pregnancies if they are not in a position to take care of a child.

Anyone can sue and the suer can collect $10,000 in damages.\nFirst, we need to understand why Roe v. Wade stands. Roe v.

If the Supreme Court had decided in favor of the state, it would have been a violation of the state law.\nThe constitutional right to privacy is not necessarily restricted to abortion but also applies to other matters such as contraception. The main difference between the right to privacy and abortion is that the latter allows the State to prevent the unborn from being born.\nAs you can see, this makes it difficult to reconcile abortion with privacy, but it is also the other way around. For example, this could be the case for people who want an abortion but do not want to raise their children and would prefer to have them die at the hands of an abortionist.\nFurthermore, the right to privacy is only constitutional when it does not affect the State. If the state can act to enforce a policy or law that violates the right to privacy, then it violates the right to privacy. This is why Roe v.

However, Japan has a very strong stance against public nudity and all forms of obscenity.\nNudity laws in Japan forbid a person from exposing the sexual organs of either their own or another's body.

Although there have been no instances of women being arrested for topless sunbathing, they are indeed breaking a law. Men, on the other hand, are not allowed to be completely naked or expose the breasts, which will result in an arrest.\nIndecency laws in Japan define certain actions as obscene or indecent. These laws forbid public displays of a sexual nature, but also forbid acts such as sexual activity, prostitution, and sexual assault.

You're correct that all are different. 2nd degree murder and 3rd degree murder are specific under Texas statutes.

If someone was killed through your negligence, you can be convicted of a misdemeanor offense, called criminal negligence. You can also be convicted of a felony if you are convicted of Involuntary Manslaughter. Involuntary Manslaughter is the negligent act that causes a death. 3rd degree murder is based on reckless conduct. It is based on facts of the crime. Involuntary manslaughter is based on the crime, but also takes into account if the person was negligent or reckless. A person can be guilty of 2nd degree murder, which is the unlawful killing of a person with intent to kill. 2nd degree murder is the highest level of intent. The courts have decided that 2nd degree murder is not the same as a premeditated murder, which is 1st degree murder.

The more important issue is the use of firearms by criminals.

The statistics show that the statewide rate of violent crime has fallen from 542.5 per 100,000 people in 1993 to 348.9 per 100,000 people in 2015, a 35% decrease over the period.

Similarly, the rate of robbery has fallen from 143.2 per 100,000 people in 1993 to 76.9 per 100,000 in 2015, a 46% decrease over the period.\nContrary to what some may believe, not all states with restrictive gun laws have more gun deaths than states with more permissive laws.", "text2": "With intervention and testing, gun homicides can be reduced dramatically in the strictest gun control states.

As a result, people are beguiled into another false belief, namely that more gun control in America is inevitably going to save lives.\nFrom different perspectives, nobody like the tragic toll of gun related homicide. It is proof of how people have diminished their regard for human life. Each and every death is a family loss. The lost future of the opportunity for life in the lost youth of murder victims can never be replaced. At the same time, the family burden of hopelessness over the loss is exacerbated by our system of justice.\nTraditional philosophies fail America in many areas, but the most obvious to victims is the inability of our justice system to bring closure to relatives. The peripatetic add-on nature of penalties for felons and murderers guarantees that everyone who suffers under the gun will endure years of distress.\nTraditionally, advocates of gun control usually overlook the importance of judicial penalties for crime as interrelated to outside factors. Most believe that more measures of informed science should be implemented. We could also use more political resolve and even a Congress influenced by public opinion.\nBuilt into any evolving system for every improvement there are those who will become the victims and supporters of crime.

Additionally, the grief and despair felt by families due to the loss is worsened by the legal system in place. Victims often feel let down by traditional philosophies in America, particularly by the justice system's failure to provide closure to their relatives. The fluctuating and additional penalties imposed on felons and murderers ensure that those affected by gun violence will experience prolonged suffering. Advocates of gun control typically fail to consider the significance of legal consequences for criminal behavior in relation to external influences. The general consensus is that additional scientific measures should be put into place. Increased political determination and a Congress swayed by the views of the public could also be beneficial.

{"prefix": "Q: Why can't a lie detector always be used in court to solve cases?\nA:", "text1": "Lie detectors were banned in American courtrooms in 1993 because most scientists believe that they are not accurate. People can fool the test, and many factors can influence their results. For example, some people may feel anxious and nervous under stress, while others don't show much change in their behavior. These differences can make it difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from lie detector tests.\nDetectives and defense lawyers can use a lie detector's results in different ways. For example, a defense lawyer may use a lie detector result as evidence to prove that their client did not commit a crime. At the same time, a detective can argue that a lie detector's result doesn't prove anything.\nQ: Does a lie detector really tell if a person is lying or telling the truth?\nA: In a word, no. The tool is called a lie detector, but that's not quite accurate. It's not a test that proves whether a person is lying or telling the truth. Instead, it measures how the body reacts to a person's emotional responses. It checks for a person's physical reactions, including changes in their breathing, heart rate, sweating, and blood pressure.\nSome of these reactions may occur when people lie, but they also can happen when people are anxious, confused, or stressed. Lie detectors are inaccurate because people can control their reactions and hide their true feelings.

Why does DUI automatically send you to jail, yet texting and driving is just as if not more dangerous, but does not carry nearly the consequences?\nA:", "text1": "Thanks for your question. The answer to that is simple: one is a crime; the other is not. Under Idaho Code \u00a718-8002(3), an arrest for operating a vehicle under the influence (OUI) of alcohol is considered a \u201cpetty offense\u201d (essentially, the minimum degree of a misdemeanor). Other related charges, such as refusal to submit to chemical testing, and driving while suspended or revoked for an OUI conviction, are also considered \u201cpetty offenses\u201d under Idaho law. By definition, under Idaho Code \u00a719-2002, a petty offense means that the person is not necessarily going to jail as a result of a conviction, unless it is a \u201cprima facie\u201d or \u201cper se\u201d misdemeanor, which means the crime is so inherently dangerous or a person is so obviously likely to reoffend that jail is required. OUI clearly fits this bill. As you mentioned, texting and driving is not. But wait\u2026don\u2019t drivers who text and drive pose just as much of a risk, if not more, than drivers who drive under the influence? I think the answer to that question is not as black and white as you might think.

In other words, you cannot record a conversation, including by way of a hidden camera, without the permission of all parties to the conversation. The Act also makes it a crime to disclose the contents of the recorded conversation to a third person. This is merely a brief, general overview of the applicable laws and should not be construed in any manner as legal advice or a legal opinion. We have found that the law does allow for the recording of conversations when one of the parties can hear the conversation going on. For example, if you set up a recorder to record a conversation in an office to catch a suspect, it would be unlawful since the suspect does not have prior knowledge of the recorder and most likely would not have agreed to the same prior to the recordings. As experts in this field, we have challenged recordings made on school campuses that did not allow for consent when it pertained to a staff member, parent, or guest on a school campus.

The law permits recording conversations if at least one party is aware of the recording. Recording a conversation in an office without the suspect's knowledge or consent would be illegal under the Illinois Eavesdropping Act.

Suspending and expelling students often disrupts their learning and the learning of their classmates. Students who are removed from class are more likely to be truant and less likely to achieve academically.\nQ: what are some alternatives to suspensions and expulsions?\nA: There are several alternatives to suspending and expelling students for bad behavior.\nZero-Tolerance Polices\nZero-tolerance policies were introduced in the 1980s as a way to discipline students who acted out. Schools had many disciplinary problems in the 1980s and needed some way to deal with problem students. These policies were thought to provide an easier way to deal with troublemakers. These policies require that specific actions or behaviors be punished by exclusionary discipline.\nAlternative discipline plans have emerged as a method to deal with the problem of suspending and expelling students.

Huge bail can prevent an innocent person from being bailed out. Also, a high bail can ensure that someone will remain in jail.\nSo it seems as if keeping someone in jail would be the primary goal. But this post says that the purpose of high bail is to keep rich people out of jail. Isn't this the opposite of what is beneficial to society?\nTo answer this question, let's explore why you might want to have someone stay in jail.\nJail is horrific. Why would anyone want to incarcerate someone who didn't commit a crime? The short answer is because money bail does what it is supposed to do: compel a defendant to return to court. If someone cannot afford to pay a high bail, they will stay in jail. If they can afford to pay, they will be released and the bail money will be kept safe from forfeiture.\nBut under the Sixth Amendment of the US Constitution (as explained by the US Supreme Court decision of \"United States vs Nixon\") a monetary penalty must be aimed towards a purpose related to reforming. In other words, the purpose of the punishment should be to make the perpetrator a better person (by example, through public humiliation, loss of work, penance, or other). The bail system ensures that this money is spent towards this goal.", "text3": "The idea of cash bail keeps being brought up in ongoing discussions. Exorbitant bail amounts may hinder the release of individuals who are not guilty. Furthermore, a substantial bail amount can guarantee that an individual stays incarcerated. It appears that the main objective is to ensure individuals remain in jail. However, this post argues that the intention behind high bail is to prevent wealthy individuals from being incarcerated. Is this not counterproductive to the well-being of society? Being in jail is terrible. What is the rationale behind imprisoning innocent individuals? Money bail effectively ensures that a defendant will show up for court. Individuals who are unable to pay a high bail amount will remain incarcerated. Those who have the financial means to pay bail will be released and their money will be safeguarded. However, according to the Sixth Amendment of the US Constitution and the US Supreme Court decision in \"United States vs Nixon,\" a monetary penalty must have a reform-related purpose. Put simply, the goal of punishment should be to improve the individual through means such as public embarrassment, job loss, or penance.

It is NOT because a person is mentally ill. It can be established for a variety of reasons: mental illness, physical illness, or even if they are a minor child. Even though people often use the word \u201cmental illness\u201d to describe someone who is in a conservatorship, it can apply to a variety of conditions. Most likely, she has a physical condition that cannot be controlled by medication or even with surgery. Please keep in mind that she is an adult, and can still make her own decisions.

The court appointed him as her conservator because her estate was valued at over $1,000,000, making it subject to court supervision. Her estate also has legal rights, and can make their own decisions without her father or conservator being involved.

There are so many homeless people.\nA:", "text1": "There are many reasons why cities become abandoned and I'll try to mention some of the more common reasons. The reasons for a particular city's abandonment are many times not known. Often the area is not a desirable area. Maybe it is located in a flood plain, in a low land area that would flood, or there is no clean water. It may be isolated with no access roads or is too far away from a city or village to support its residents. Often the area was built up and the population of the area never recovered from an outside attack (outside the area) and was never repopulated. The area is often not fit for farming, mining, or to build houses or buildings. Or, as is the case with many American ghost towns, the resources that were in the area were tapped out, leaving the area barren and less able to support people.\nAnother reason could be that a hurricane, earthquake, landslide, or even a volcano destroyed the city and the area is unable to support its residents. The area could also have become abandoned due to pollution or contamination (radioactive), poor ground or ground water quality, bad air quality, dangerous water sources, or maybe was over-run by a plague or a massive epidemic of disease. Abandoned cities could be located in an area that is at a high elevation and there are very few inhabitable sites that are not steep slopes or have too shallow a soil.", "text2": "Good premise! You noticed something relevant and worth mentioning, I suppose. Question is, what do you actually mean?\nThis is needed before any speculation concerning homeless, pooches or cities can be ventured. Do you mean that more and better shelter should be provided, or that some change in the people themselves should be executed? Mostly that \"homeless people\" should learn to become less homeless to attract the attention of authorities and privileges like housing and jobs?\nIf so, this question belongs to The Dogs and Barkers article which was provisionally presented under the title of Keep Out. Considering the fact that any tier of ethic consists in setting limits on nature, enough bark is required to scare off nature (homelessness) and keep out. The reaction of nature is simple: if unappeased, it will only continue until it cracks open the skull. If opposed nature starts to act agitated and worse.\nThat is why people cannot exist without dogs, as society is to restrain nature in us. Civilization is the last-tier restraint, civilization needs to be upheld by an institution, a representative of civilization. If the barbarians start to act like barbarians, it's game over.

If that's the case, this question is related to the article \"The Dogs and Barkers\" which was tentatively titled \"Keep Out.\" Sufficient barking is needed to deter homelessness and keep it away, as ethics involve placing boundaries on nature. If nature is not satisfied, it will persist until it causes harm. If nature becomes agitated and behaves negatively. People need dogs in order to control their natural instincts and behaviors within society. An institution must uphold civilization as the final form of restraint.

You win even if the asset only increases by the percentage you purchased the option for, and in fact you can make money if the asset only goes up by a few percent, since the price of the option decreases over time.\nIf you buy the option, you are betting that the asset will go up by at least 1% by the end of the year, or else you will lose your original investment.

{"prefix": "Q: Why do grocery prices increase with fuel price increases but not decrease with fuel price decreases?\nA:", "text1": "This question is largely based on a bit of faulty information: that the price of food increases with the price of fuel. In fact, the relationship between food and fuel prices is much more complicated than that.\nAll food is grown by farmers and moved to consumers using various forms of transport. As such, transportation costs (i.e. fuel) are a major cost to the food supply chain. However, changes in food prices do not reflect transportation costs, and certainly not fuel prices.\nWhat determines food prices? Food is largely determined by a combination of the cost of production, global market demand, and the national economic outlook.\nBoth the cost of production and global demand are determined by a combination of a number of factors such as supply, exports, imports, weather, foreign currency rates, and production capacity. As we have seen in the past few years, this has led to large shifts in prices in both directions. These have resulted in spikes and crashes in global food prices. The global price of food can fluctuate by as much as 30% in a year, independent of transport and oil prices. In fact, the transportation cost of food, once sourced, typically makes up less than 10% of the total price.\nNational economic outlooks, on the other hand, tend to fluctuate over a longer time frame and are determined by more complicated and longer-term changes such as employment, interest rates, confidence and consumer spending patterns.", "text2": "I suspect it is a combination of rising transport costs due to more transport applications requiring diesel and reduced diesel exportations due to pressures on diesel fuel supply since it can be used for so many purposes. It mostly addresses public transport demands for buses, trains and taxis. This is covered in the Wikipedia entry on rising transport costs.\nThe country's enduring reliance on fossil fuels (currently total electricity is generated by 31.2% coal, 25.3% diesel, 12.7% nuclear, 8.3% hydropower, 7.2% renewable energy, and another 15.3% from import barges, mostly liquefied natural gas from the Western Cape Shore the the terminates on the Eastern Shore of the Pacific) bears a heavy economic stress on this country. So rising transport costs becomes a way to manage supply when there is a critical need to reduce fuel consumption in some sectors of the economy.\nSo government manipulates the economy in ways that might better politically suit its motivations \u2013 in this case, sustaining the coal-fired power stations by keeping up the price of diesel as it keeps electricity costs for the public sector and the grid well below the actual running costs of the plant. So every time the price of coal rises, and it is on the international markets, so rises the price of electricity retailed by to the consumers. Electricity is mandated by the government itself as the favourite method of production the runs the National Grid.

The country's heavy economic burden is caused by its continued dependence on fossil fuels, with a significant portion of electricity generated from coal, diesel, and other sources. Increasing transportation costs are used as a strategy to decrease fuel consumption in certain sectors of the economy. The government adjusts the economy to support coal-fired power stations by maintaining high diesel prices, which in turn keeps electricity costs low for the public sector and the grid. Whenever the cost of coal increases on the global market, the price of electricity sold to consumers also increases.

{"prefix": "Q: How do banks make money from lending if they loan money at a lower rate than inflation?\nA:", "text1": "Inflation is defined as the average rise in the general price level over time. For example, if the price level is 100 in 2021 and 120 in 2022, then inflation will be 20% (120/100 -1).\nHence, the more the inflation, the lower the purchasing power of money. As such, if you\u2019re going to lend money at an interest rate of 4% per annum and the inflation is 12%, your real interest rate (i.e. the interest rate after adjusting for inflation) will be -8%.\nIt is common for banks to lend at higher interest rates than the central bank\u2019s cash interest rate (as stipulated in the official policy rate). In Indonesia, for example, the highest lending rate for individuals is 10% per annum whereas the Bank Indonesia interest rate is only 5.25% (as of July 2021). However, bank lending interest rates are not immune to market forces. In an environment where there are many bank competitors and the central bank interest rate is low, it is possible that banks may lend below the central bank interest rate (e.g. in a market where the central bank interest rate is 4% per annum but bank lending rates are only 2% per annum). Nevertheless, this situation usually arises in a specific market segment, such as businesses that have large cash reserves but cannot make use of them.", "text2": "Banks are not money-making machines, but just repositories of savings that can be utilized, with a margin, for earning purposes \u2013 by advising people about a proper usage. They need to keep a proper margin because one should keep room for risk ahead of time. Suppose you have 1 to 2 per cent margin then you are not too far. There is a possibility of default, so banks create a buffer stock under the term \u2018provision\u2019 against this. During 2008-2009, banks had huge provisioning and they used their own resources to sustain these losses. They never went to the government nor did the RBI ever ask them to transfer losses to the government. Banks need to keep this provisioning and create a layer before doing any lending. This is mainly done for the sake of the lender in case of default. Banks have to keep in mind the safety of the depositors. No investment is ever risk free and the assumption behind the question is that it is the poorest earning in the market when it needs not necessarily be the case. However, the difference between the deposit rate and the lending rate is generally low. In most cases, depositors are not too worried if they receive anything on the deposit because at times of emergency, they can adjust their withdrawal with interest. But banks should continuously remind themselves that if borrowers default them, then they might also walk out of their commitments.", "text3": "Banks are not designed to make money themselves, but rather to hold savings that can be used to generate income through proper guidance. It is important to maintain a sufficient margin to account for potential risks in advance. If you have a margin of 1 to 2 percent, you are in a good position. Banks set aside a reserve known as 'provision' to protect against potential defaults. In 2008-2009, banks had significant provisions and had to rely on their own resources to cover the losses. They did not seek government assistance or transfer losses to the RBI. Banks must set aside provisions before lending any money. This is primarily done to protect the lender in the event of a default. Banks must prioritize the security of depositors. Not all investments are without risk, and the question assumes that the lowest earners in the market are always the most vulnerable, which may not always be true. Typically, there is a small margin between the interest rates for deposits and loans.

The deal cost Huang less than $30,000. (Note that $7,000 worth of NFTs are currently trading on OpenSea for $19, which is 71.7% off.)\nThe transfer caused panic among NFT collectors. It is not uncommon for investors to move NFT assets from exchange to exchange, but in the midst of the crisis, many were quick to jump to conclusions.\nAccording to CoinDesk, Huang was charged with \u201cviolation of the People\u2019s Republic of China Real Estate Law\u201d.", "text2": "In China\u2019s villages, in empty offices, and in family heirlooms.\nNOTE: This answering machine message is approved by Millet Engelberg, who will have nothing to do with any correspondence resulting from this or subsequent postings.\nThe average dry land farmer in Jiangsu, Anhui, or Zhejiang can now produce as much food as four farmers did at the beginning of the century.

{"prefix": "Q: How can large countries take up a lot of debt yet still have strong economies?\nA:", "text1": "The first issue is that debt is not just government debt. Government debt is part of the broader picture of debt. Here's a quick example to explain how broader debt measures can be more useful than just looking at government debt.\nSay you have a kid in college and you give them $100,000 to go to school. If they keep $50,000 for living expenses and spend the rest on education, your debt goes down. The $50,000 they spend on living expenses is debt they assume, but it doesn't show up in the government figures because it's in the private sector. If you assume that total private sector debt in the United States, including the household, financial, and corporate sectors, is about the same as total U.S. government debt, then it means that the United States actually has about $2 trillion of private sector debt. This is much more than government debt, which means it's not the government that's borrowing this money. (For related reading, see The Real Cost Of Student Loans.)\nSo how does this explain why large countries can take on more debt than smaller countries? The larger the country, the larger the economy, and the more of that economy is in the private sector. For example, the United States has the largest economy in the world, so it has more private sector debt. Meanwhile, smaller countries will have more government debt because the private sector is so much smaller.", "text2": "The illustrative answer given to the above hypothetical question is that they have economies large enough to be able to \u201cstomach\u201d large debts and continue to function properly, while less productive smaller economies could end up suffering some economic maladies as a result of having debts that could not be repaid.\nThe above hypothetical question and answer sound simple and intuitive, and they could be readily understood by anyone about economies.

If the stock price has declined, the investor can profit from the difference between the sale price and the buyback price.

Generally, the more liquid and actively traded the stock, the lower the borrowing cost.\nQ: What is the impact of short-selling on other investors and the stock price?\nA: When short-sellers borrow shares of stock, they \u201copen\u201d a short position that creates a negative liability. When a short position is opened, the number of shares available to sell declines. If demand to buy a stock increases, prices go up, which can cause short-sellers to close their short positions to limit potential losses. When a short position is closed, the number of shares available to sell increases. The presence of both open and closed short positions can influence the price movements of the underlying stock.\nQ: Does short-selling cause or increase volatility?\nA: Short-sellers are by definition traders, but some who are either skilled or lucky may use their positions to influence prices, which could increase price volatility.

It can help a business expand beyond its current limits. But a well-planned business strategy is the key to implement labour to make your business successful. Choosing the right staff for the job is necessary. It is advisable to get help of a temporary staffing agency. They take care of the background check and other formalities, so that the employee hired is suitable for the work he is being assigned. As the company has the advantage to terminate a temporary employee as and when required, it is beneficial for them to get them on contract. In a long run, a company saves their cost. An example is that the maintenance staff, for whom the wages are paid on an hourly basis. They are paid weekly. Hence, if they miss even a single day, they are liable to be paid for that. So it\u2019s better to hire a contractor, who gets paid weekly and the payment is fixed. Thus it reduces the cost of the company and they can concentrate on their core business.\nA: Many workers do the job through contract without getting sick pay and other benefits. This allows the companies to save the cost of benefits. In India, few companies are hiring the workers through contract to save this cost.

The payments are often structured in such a way that the initial investors are guaranteed to receive payments while later investors are not, which can create a situation where the early investors are able to make a profit at the expense of later investors.\nThe problem with pyramid schemes is that they can become unsustainable over time as the payments to early investors become increasingly difficult to make. This can lead to a situation where the company or organization behind the pyramid scheme is unable to continue making payments to investors, which can result in significant losses for both the investors and the company itself.\nOne way to avoid getting caught up in a pyramid scheme is to do your research and make sure that the company or organization behind the scheme is legitimate and has a track record of making payments to investors in a timely manner. You can also look for red flags such as promises of high returns or guaranteed payments, which are often associated with pyramid schemes.\nAnother way to avoid pyramid schemes is to understand the risks involved in investing in them.", "text2": "According to the National Do-Not-Call Registry website:\nPyramid schemes are on the rise.

In other words, the bond market revolves around two incredibly simple statements: buying = price up; selling = price down.

However, you can separate out a home\u2019s value into its real estate portion and the value of the financing portion. Let\u2019s use an example to see how this works.\nWith inflation, it\u2019s not surprising that over the last 100 years, the price of real estate has gone up, since the inflation rate is generally expressed in terms of price increases, like the cost of housing. This is similar to your comment that housing has gone up dramatically both in absolute and relative terms. The issue here is that these measures do not include the cost of financing a home.\nThink about buying a new car. While the price of the car may not have changed, the financing costs have gone up. The effective price of a new car has therefore gone up due to the increase in interest rates and other financing costs. Since you did not account for this increase in financing costs, you are left with the impression that the price of the car has gone up.\nHousing is the same way.

The higher your score, the better your credit rating.\nSo, for example, let's say you apply for a loan to buy a house. A lender reviews your credit report and looks at your credit score. If it's too low, they may deny your application. And your score is only part of the picture. The lender may also check out your income and savings and how long you've been at your current job.\nCredit scores can range from 300 to 900. The higher the number, the better your score. Different lenders use different formulas to calculate your credit score, but all of them consider five factors: your payment history, the amount of debt you owe, how long you've had credit, what type of credit you have, and whether you've applied for credit recently. Each lender gives each factor a certain weight when calculating your credit score.\nHow can you find out your credit score?

Different creditors use different scales, but their scores should be approximate.\nBank of America (BofA) also regularly describes customers as being at risk for bad credit, though it doesn't specify how much they've lost or gained.\nAnd Wells Fargo reports going from $1,400 to just $470 in the last six months, which is more significant than the BofA decline.\nIn each case, the figures given by banks aren't specific either: To the public they say things like \"now we're losing money\", instead of \"people will stop sending us money forever.\" A worse situation than this could occur!\n[redirect url=\u2019http://gsbn.info/bump\u2019 sec=\u20197\u2032]://\u4f5c ccount.", "text3": "A credit score is a rating used to monitor how you spend money.

In bankruptcy, an enterprise can recover from insolvency and gain flexibility to make better strategic decisions to keep it running.\nIn the case of Hertz, this flexibility allowed the company to reach an agreement with Tesla, which enabled it to switch to the Model 3 as its primary rental car model.\nTo learn more about this subject, check out my new book, Essentials of Corporate Finance.", "text2": "The company was dying.

That country would be able to print as many dollars as they wanted. If this country did not have a natural advantage to begin with, they would probably go into deep debt. On the other hand, if a country had a natural advantage, that country would probably try to devalue their currency to the point where they could export their goods cheaply.

There are problems in using currency. Cracking a window and frying an egg makes it obvious just why using paper currency has significant disadvantages and the same symptoms of those disadvantages are indications of problems in the strength of the currency.\nMoney supply can change as people decide to store or to spend it for goods and services. That is another reason that inflation reduced by traditional quantitative easing has limited scope. The Fed has mopped up some of the cash in circulation by paying interest on reserves for banks. Even at that, the extent of the reduction is quite minor. This mopping up of the cash, if it were actually effective, would offset a large portion of the growth from quantitative easing via the printing of more money or easier borrowing for bankers.

{"prefix": "Q: - Why do derivatives markets exist?\nA:", "text1": "- Because of asset substitution. Investors would be willing to switch from non-derivative assets to derivative assets if the return on the latter is higher than that on the former. Also, if two assets have equal returns, investors might prefer to hold the asset that gives them a right to substitute the asset for something else. This gives rise to derivatives markets. For example, a company can convert its non-derivative debt into a debt with a put option. This type of conversion of a security into an option on the same security is called asset substitution.\nQ: - What does it mean to hedge?\nA: - To hedge is to take an opposite position in a derivative or a non-derivative asset to reduce your risk from another position. It is also to reduce risk from other sources. By doing so, one is reducing exposure to market risk. This is why hedging is also referred to as risk management or risk reduction.\nQ: - How is the value of derivatives determined?\nA: - The price of derivatives is the sum of the present value of future cash flows resulting from the derivative. It is like a bond with a series of future cash flows. Let\u2019s take a bond with a face value of Rs.1000 and 5 years to maturity and 8% coupon (Rs.80 per year). Assume that the interest rate is 8%.

This article from Bloomberg is entitled \u201c Inflation Retreats to the 2% Target as Fed Debates a First Hike.\u201d\nHow much is 2%? The inflation rate in October was 2%. As for what that means,\u00a0 Wikipedia tells us that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) \u201cis a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care. It is a statistical estimate obtained through economic surveys and calculations, not an arithmetic average or a simple sum of goods prices.\u201d One basket. One weighting. Lots of assumptions. Measured at just two percent. Inflation is that serious.\nHow does the CPI work? There are two kinds of indexing: the \u201cchained index\u201d and the \u201cfixed-weight index.\u201d Chained indexing measures things at the time they are purchased, and the fixed-weight index measures items as they are in the basket when the basket was set up. The Consumer Price Index is based on the \u201cchained index\u201d system. This means that if a product (like a car) falls in price over time, the impact on the CPI will be lower in the later year, because the car would have been more expensive if it were purchased in the earlier year.\nIf a new product is introduced, the older version of the product is \u201cchained\u201d out of the basket.", "text2": "1.

It is the business model used by many direct selling companies.\nA: Each company designs and manufactures their products. Many choose to source parts from China, where costs are lower.

See our List of 30 Companies for details.\nQ: What is the business model?\nA: As it states in the title, it is a multi-level marketing company. Essentially, a company pays commissions to people based on how many levels they bring in to their organization. In the U.S., you can only make money by bringing others into the organization, and/or by selling product. Some people make a lot of money because they bring in a lot of people, but you don't have to recruit anyone to sell product.

In these cases, a job loss, an illness or accident, or the end of a relationship could have triggered the inability to make ends meet.\nA little more than one-quarter of the cases Chiang sees are primarily due to overspending, for which the debtor has few assets.

{"prefix": "Q: Does inflation theoretically continue forever? Or does it somehow reset?\nA:", "text1": "Inflation may appear to reset, but it never really does. Say the nominal price of a candy bar is currently $1.00. It may seem like inflation is resetting when the price suddenly rises to $2.00, but the true level of inflation is continuing in the same direction and is now more apparent.\nQ: Are wage increases fully inflationary?\nA: If you earn an increase in your salary, and your expenses also increase by the same amount, you won't feel the effects of inflation because your relative financial position has not changed.\nInflation can be directly reflected in costs or wages, and not in the CPI, because the measurement of inflation lags the pricing of goods and services. As wages rise with inflation, the measured rate of inflation can actually go down. For example, an increase in wages is reflected in the CPI at the time of receipt of those wages, but not at the time of increase in the price of goods and services, which might be a year or more later.\nIn addition, the economy may be able to absorb increases in wages without negative economic consequences, since wage increases are often intended to match the increase in productivity. However, wage increases should be designed to include provisions for eliminating inflation at a later date in order to avoid creating more inflation than is needed to achieve the desired goal.\nQ: How can banks control their costs and expenses?", "text2": "It depends. When people talk about inflation in the media, they usually mean cumulative price increases. That\u2019s why numbers are sometimes expressed in terms of a \u201cdoubling time.\u201d For example, an annual inflation rate of 2% translates to a doubling time of 35.3 years.\nBut \u201cdoubling time\u201d is a contrivance. It\u2019s the amount of time it takes for the price of something \u2013 say, a turkey at Thanksgiving \u2013 to become twice its former price. It is an imaginary milestone, one with no fundamental significance. It does not, for example, constitute an asymptote.\nMoney plays this game with monetary policy. To the extent to which they raise interest rates, they make \u201cdoubling time\u201d longer \u2013 via a higher \u201cdollar,\u201d i.e. the value of that dollar currency unit in terms of something, anything.\nNote that such an adjustment only takes a country so far.

In the media, inflation is typically discussed as a result of overall price increases. This is why figures are occasionally presented in relation to how long it takes for them to double. An annual inflation rate of 2% means it would take 35.3 years for prices to double. However, the concept of \"doubling time\" is artificial. The doubling time is the duration it takes for the price of an item, such as a Thanksgiving turkey, to double. It is a made-up point that doesn't hold any real importance. For instance, it does not represent an asymptote. Monetary policy involves money in this game. By increasing interest rates, they extend the time it takes for prices to double, essentially increasing the value of the dollar currency unit. Keep in mind that this type of adjustment can only go a certain distance in a country. Traveling back in time includes the currency of that country. It pertains to what lies ahead. Pay attention to the final point made in the article, which mentions that consumer prices were at their lowest in a century, with the pound almost reaching a value of $5 in the 1960s.

First, I think you'll find that the federal and state governments calculate taxes very differently and many states don't even collect state income taxes. Second, I don't believe that taxes are ever calculated on the basis of a week, but rather on a calendar year. If that's the case, overtime would never be considered \"normal\" or even less than \"normal\" when taxes are calculated.\nThe second part of your question concerns how \"time-and-a-half\" is calculated. This is where I think you'll find the most confusion. In many states, there is a particular hourly rate at which \"overtime\" is calculated. This rate is different than the rate at which taxes are calculated and they are not the same for everybody.\nFirst of all, the \"time-and-a-half\" rate is not the rate at which you are compensated. As you know, the overtime rate is 1.5x your regular rate. Your gross hourly rate (what your employer pays you before taxes and other payroll deductions) is not 1.5x your regular rate.

While the government has historically dealt with inflation by raising interest rates, inflation simply continues to climb when interest rates hit their maximum, as they did during the 1920s in Germany, in the 1970s in Poland, and in 2000 in Zimbabwe.\nTo combat this, the government is forced to start printing more money, essentially creating a new currency. During the Weimar Republic, Germany created a new currency 49 times in 14 years. The European Union had to bail out Greece, Ireland, and Portugal after they became unable to service their debt, due to their continued printing of money.\nWhile the Eurozone fixed the debt of these countries by borrowing money from the rest of Europe, Germany has passed reforms requiring countries to balance their budget if they use the Euro. Because these countries cannot print their own money, inflation is now unlikely, and if it were to occur, they would not be able to control it.\nWhile inflation occurs often in developing countries, it also occurs in advanced countries when central banks print more money than they should. The only countries that may not be able to print their own currency are oil-producing countries, which have their own currency backed by oil.
