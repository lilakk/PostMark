Despite facing numerous challenges, the Mongol commanders and their troops persevered and successfully reached their destination, only to encounter strong resistance from the local defenders upon landing on the beach. The Mongols quickly defeated the enemy due to their larger army and military skills. In the midst of the battle, Sangqudar took the lead and fought with his renowned weapon. The invading army continued to advance, swiftly seizing important strongholds and fortresses. Governor Taipn demonstrated his skill as a tactician by strategically outmaneuvering the enemy and securing crucial positions.

Following extensive discussions and legal advice, the tribal council suggested a compromise by introducing a new membership category known as \"Friends of the Tribe.\" The new membership category \"Friends of the Tribe\" would allow individuals who have supported the tribe but do not qualify for full membership to engage in tribal activities, organize cultural events, and receive various benefits. The proposal for the new membership category was met with a combination of relief and doubt, as it would not grant voting rights or access to tribal funds. While some members saw the new membership category as a way to recognize non-Native contributions and respect tribal sovereignty, others were concerned it may not fully acknowledge the value of those contributions. In the end, the United Keetoowah Band decided to establish the \"Friends of the Tribe\" category. While not ideal, it was a positive move towards addressing the intricate issue of tribal involvement and inclusion. The tribe worked to address these challenges and find ways to involve their allies and backers while maintaining their community's sovereignty and integrity.", "detect1": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.5546270995339668, "n": 212, "ones": 105, "z_value": -0.13736056394868904}, "detect2": {"is_watermark": "True", "p_value": 9.313441753987662e-11, "n": 213, "ones": 153, "z_value": 6.372255001396044}, "detect3": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.6753945969951923, "n": 174, "ones": 84, "z_value": -0.454858826147342}}

Xanana was elected in the first presidential and parliamentary elections held in East Timor in May 2002. Gusm\u00e3o, a prominent leader in the resistance against Indonesia, became the first president of the nation. Gusm\u00e3o's Fretilin party secured a majority in the assembly, setting the stage for the establishment of a new government. In August 2002, East Timor gained independence, closing a challenging chapter in its history. Despite international support, East Timor faced challenges on its path to becoming a stable and prosperous democracy. Despite the advancements, the lasting impact of violence and displacement continued to burden the people of East Timor.

In 1901, Japan established the Vickers Armstrong Marine Works in Yokosuka with British engineers and laborers, leading to the launch of the first Japanese-made battleship, the \"Yamashiro,\" in 1902. This endeavor's success laid the foundation for Japan's naval shipbuilding industry and solidified its position as a significant naval power in the Asia-Pacific region. Recognizing the benefits of constructing the Fus\u014d in the UK, the IJN realized the importance of increasing independence in naval shipbuilding. The creation of the Vickers Armstrong Marine Works was a significant milestone in Japan's quest for independence in naval shipbuilding and solidifying its global power status.", "detect1": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.27622645244088895, "n": 102, "ones": 54, "z_value": 0.5940885257860046}, "detect2": {"is_watermark": "True", "p_value": 1.1718335355056701e-10, "n": 102, "ones": 83, "z_value": 6.336944275050716}, "detect3": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.25116747718025106, "n": 80, "ones": 43, "z_value": 0.6708203932499369}}

{"text1": "Despite the initial hostility and the devastating impact of the European settlers on their lives, some Aboriginal communities attempted to establish peaceful coexistence with the newcomers. However, these attempts were often short-lived as the demand for land and resources continued to expand.\n\nMany Aboriginal peoples were forcibly removed from their lands and relocated to reservations or missions, where they were subjected to harsh living conditions and forced labor. Children were taken away from their families and placed in institutions, a practice known as the Stolen Generations.\n\nDespite the hardships, Aboriginal resistance to European colonialism never truly ceased. From small-scale acts of sabotage and raids on European settlements to larger-scale uprisings like the Eumeralla War in Victoria and the Nyungar resistance in Western Australia, Aboriginal peoples continued to defend their lands and their way of life.\n\nThroughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, European settlers continued to expand their territories, leading to further conflicts and displacement of Aboriginal peoples.

During the siege at \u014cr\u0101kau, the Australians played a crucial role in defending the British positions and repelling numerous Maori raids at the well-fortified settlement. Their resilience and skill in combat were essential in repelling the Maori assault. Ultimately, the Australians strategically maneuvered at Te Ranga to flank the Maori forces, causing them to retreat and leave their stronghold. The Australians' crucial role in the Waikato War was highlighted by their success at Te Ranga, ultimately leading to the British victory despite their limited participation in major battles. Their courage and determination in difficult circumstances garnered the respect and praise of the British and paved the way for Australia's future military achievements.", "detect1": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.45956303976738927, "n": 97, "ones": 49, "z_value": 0.10153461651336192}, "detect2": {"is_watermark": "True", "p_value": 1.1725156560134907e-08, "n": 97, "ones": 76, "z_value": 5.584403908234905}, "detect3": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.5404369602326108, "n": 97, "ones": 48, "z_value": -0.10153461651336192}}

However, the film's darker tone and fresh take, with Daniel Craig making his first appearance as James Bond, was well-received by both critics and audiences. The decrease in product placements did not result in insignificant monetary gains. Critics had often criticized the revenue generated from product placements in the Bond films. While some viewed it as a practical measure to control production costs, others felt it devalued the cinematic experience and weakened the storytelling. Michael Wilson and Albert R. were the producers. Initially hesitant, Broccoli eventually embraced product placement in Bond films due to rising production costs and the need to recover funds, with Casino Royale marking a shift in the franchise's approach to this practice. Barbara Broccoli and Michael G were the producers. Wilson recognized the need to find a middle ground between financial considerations and artistic vision. In the subsequent years, they continued to restrict the number of product placements in each movie to avoid disrupting the narrative or feeling intrusive. The Bond films successfully balanced financial success with critical acclaim and fan loyalty by integrating product placement subtly and effectively. The Bond series demonstrated that financial prosperity and creative achievement could harmoniously exist, establishing a fresh benchmark for the entire film industry.", "detect1": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.05158844004651438, "n": 122, "ones": 70, "z_value": 1.6296434287653334}, "detect2": {"is_watermark": "True", "p_value": 2.302482686939653e-09, "n": 123, "ones": 94, "z_value": 5.8608526253383095}, "detect3": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.28537519402908695, "n": 112, "ones": 59, "z_value": 0.5669467095138409}}

Labor disputes were common in the railroad and timber industries, and the city's growth brought about new social issues like poverty and crime. Despite challenges, city residents remained determined to create a prosperous community. As the railroads played a central role, cities started to grow and change, shaping the future of Mississippi and beyond.", "detect1": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.9809270818702236, "n": 134, "ones": 55, "z_value": -2.0732842213952645}, "detect2": {"is_watermark": "True", "p_value": 2.2813618877968757e-14, "n": 133, "ones": 110, "z_value": 7.543856734859843}, "detect3": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.8852892576851552, "n": 117, "ones": 52, "z_value": -1.2018504251546631}}

Coal, the primary source of fuel, had to be imported from the mainland, which was a costly and time-consuming endeavor. The lack of affordable fuel made it increasingly difficult for the island's residents to maintain their livelihoods in the fishing industry.\n\nConsequently, the population of Crabbaberry continued to decline. People began to leave the island in search of better opportunities elsewhere. By the mid-1900s, the once bustling community was reduced to a shadow of its former self, with a population of only a few dozen residents.\n\nDespite these hardships, the people of Crabbaberry remained resilient.

In the subsequent years, multiple individuals from the Oregon Highway 101 gang were apprehended and prosecuted for a range of offenses, including murder, theft, drug dealing, and extortion. The dismantling of the feared gang brought relief to the community and restored law and order, with Randy Turner's murder serving as a reminder of the destructive consequences of gang conflicts and the need for justice.
