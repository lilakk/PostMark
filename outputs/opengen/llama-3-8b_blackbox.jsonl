Ultimately, General Greiner decided to go back to Mandalay to meet with the King. The war between the British and the Burmese ended. The Burmese were not finished yet. The Burmese representatives traveled to London again after returning to England. The British Resident in Burma faced opposition from the King. Mindon granted British merchants the freedom to travel across Burma and provided extraterritorial rights to British subjects, while respecting Burmese laws and traditions. Britain agreed to safeguard the interests of the Burmese abroad under Mindon's rule. However, they were still unsatisfied and initiated talks with France. These efforts also proved to be unsuccessful under Mindon's rule. The Burmese then looked towards the US and gave a large piece of land in Lower Burma to the American Baptist Mission.

It also assisted because it is the only video I understand of that features Madonna use an actual diction rather than speaking her own words .", "text3": "Madonna says the word \"Victim\" at that moment. This indicates that she has recognized herself as a victim of society, her own sexuality, and the press. What I mean is that in this video, the same things that are supposed to trap Madonna are also what liberate her. In this video, Madonna slowly comes to understand her own sense of self. Madonna's lyrics express defiance towards those who try to control her. Madonna breaks free from confinement and starts dancing without any restrictions. She has broken free from the constraints of being seen as a mere sex symbol and from her own self-imposed limitations. At the end of the video, she is shown with the individuals who once confined her. She is no longer the same unattractive woman she used to be. She is actually liberated. I appreciated the repetition of certain scenes in the video. I enjoy observing things in a particular order. It was amazing to witness a scene and then see it from a different perspective just a couple of minutes later. It was helpful because it is the only video where Madonna is heard using scripted dialogue instead of her own words.", "detect1": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.26354462843276905, "n": 90, "ones": 48, "z_value": 0.6324555320336759}, "detect2": {"is_watermark": "True", "p_value": 1.7589223765390133e-06, "n": 90, "ones": 67, "z_value": 4.638007234913623}, "detect3": {"is_watermark": "False", "p_value": 0.6726395769907115, "n": 80, "ones": 38, "z_value": -0.4472135954999579}}

{"text1": " Later the government also announced an increase of more than 100% for the RAAF over a three-year period, and a 200% increase for the RAN over five years. The objective of the defence spending was to establish a 'credible deterrent' in the face of a perceived communist threat. This was due to Menzies having failed to persuade the U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower to provide a security guarantee for Australia and New Zealand in the face of China's looming expansion in the region.\nAustralia's experience of warfare in Korea heightened the appeal of nuclear weapons to Australian defence planners. Military thinkers held an entrenched belief that the bomb offered the only means to defend against the growing military power of the communist states. While Australia was unable to directly contribute to the development of nuclear technology, there was the assumption that the U.S. would use their new weapon if faced with an overwhelming conventional threat. And while the death toll for Australian personnel during the Korean War was considerably lower than other countries (372 personnel), there was also a general belief that the nuclear age would not be as kind to personnel as Korea had been. Given the threat of the communist advance, the Menzies government committed to a 'nuclear deterrent strategy'. This involved the development of a system of air defence and base relocation to avoid being vulnerable to enemy attack.

The center collaborates with Mississippi State University to host educational programs and events related to Jimmie Rodgers, including the Jimmie Rodgers Legacy Festival, and is supported by a grant-funded endowment for publishing a catalog of his songs. Hammond and his wife, Mary Hamilton Stoddard Hammond, were mentioned. The house, constructed in the Greek Revival architectural style, has witnessed important historical events such as the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement in the neighborhood. The Hammond family owned the house from 1858 until 1980. G opened the house to the public as a museum. The museum building, which is home to the Center for the study of Jimmie Rodgers, has a rich history and is supported by educational programs and events related to the country music legend.
