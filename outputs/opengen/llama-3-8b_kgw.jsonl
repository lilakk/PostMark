Oka's unit of about 650 men attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the Lunga perimeter. At about 04:00 on 14 September, two Japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (3/5) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses. Another Japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of 14 September. The rest of Oka's unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack. At 13:05 on 14 September, Kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle, where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day. Kawaguchi's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the Matanikau River valley to join with Oka's unit, a march over difficult terrain. Kawaguchi's troops began the march on the morning of 16 September. Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded. As the march progressed, the exhausted and hungry soldiers, who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal, began to discard their heavy equipment and then their rifles. By the time most of them reached Oka's positions at Kokumbona five days later, only half still carried their weapons. The Kuma battalion's survivors, attempting to follow Kawaguchi's Center Body forces, became lost, wandered for three weeks in the jungle, and almost starved to death before finally reaching Kawaguchi's camp. In total, Kawaguchi's forces lost about 830 killed in the attack, including 350 in Tamura's battalion, 200 in Kokusho's battalion, 120 in Oka's force, 100 in the Kuma battalion, and 60 in Watanabe's battalion.

These granite outcrops are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic ridgelines. The Trout Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, which was then beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period. The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains. The oval-shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the Oregon\u2013Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains. It is about long and wide. The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene. A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure. The caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago. The caldera contains significant ore deposits, and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera. Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. The Trout Creek Mountains are semi-arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west.

After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations. True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919 but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times. The Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas that those industries were prominent, Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women's vote and by his support of Wilson, who had lost popularity since Beckham's election, in 1914. Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3% of the vote to Beckham's 49.7&%. During his only term in the Senate, Beckham served alongside three other US Senators from Kentucky: Ollie M. James, George B. Martin, and Augustus O. Stanley. After his term in the Senate ended, Beckham resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time, he had the support of the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham.

Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985. Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown. This included construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997, based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian's Golden Age; it had been demolished. Other projects included renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann's Restaurant in 2002, as well as support for integrated urban design. Meridian Main Street, along with The Riley Foundation, helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the \"Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts.\" After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010. Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown.

The recording reflects the influence of glam rock on Starr through what authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter term \"its big drum sound and repetitious nature\". The line-up comprised Starr (vocals, drums, percussion), Harrison (guitars), Gary Wright (piano) and Klaus Voormann (bass, saxophone). Rodriguez describes Starr's \"martial-sounding opening\" as a rare \"showcase for his own drumming\", while Harrison biographer Simon Leng writes of \"a roaring series of Harrison slide breaks that brought to mind Duane Allman\". Starr later said that he incorporated a hook he had come up with for the Beatles song \"Get Back\" into his drum part on \"Back Off Boogaloo\". Further overdubs on the track included contributions from three backing vocalists, led by American soul singer Madeline Bell.

It was intended to be the theme song for the Ferdinando Baldi-directed Spaghetti Western Blindman, filming for which Starr had interrupted in order to perform at the Concert for Bangladesh. The song was passed over for inclusion in the film, since producer Tony Anthony favoured an original score by Stelvio Cipriani. Starr produced the track with Voormann. The recording sessions took place at Apple on 18\u201319 August, with Badfinger guitarist Pete Ham assisting Starr and Voormann. Like the film, \"Blindman\" was not held in high regard by critics. Spizer describes it as \"a muddy-sounding dirge with little to recommend\". By contrast, director and author Alex Cox believes that the song \"works well, in the context of the film\" compared to Cipriani's score, which he considers \"lazy\".", "text1": " In an interview shortly afterwards, Starr recalled: \"I sang it just before I went to see George's concert the other night and the audience cheered...

Rather than give in to artistic blackmail, Gauthier quit opera entirely.", "gold": "Disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene, Gauthier departed Europe and travelled to Java. There, she met a Dutch importer and plantation manager named Frans Knoote. Gauthier and Knoote married on May 22, 1911. Gauthier studied the music of Java, and began to include this in her repertoire. Her accompanying pianist was Paul Seelig, who had previously been the conductor for the Kraton of Surakarta, which afforded Gauthier a number of opportunities. On permission of the Javanese court, she studied the gamelan, probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity. While living in Java, Gauthier travelled extensively, giving performances in China, Japan, Singapore, Malaya, Australia, and New Zealand. She remained in Java for four years, but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America, arriving in New York City in the fall of 1914. Arriving in New York, Gauthier struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene. She put on a performance in Vaudeville entitled Songmotion, which combined Javan music with dancers. New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers, so Gauthier focused on her Javan musical repertoire, which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing. Gauthier began giving annual recitals at Aeolian Hall, and in November 1917 her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers. She developed her own reputation quickly, known as a \"...sensitive purveyor of interesting, untried songs\". She gave renditions of three songs by Maurice Ravel. Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky's Three Japanese Lyrics and Griffes' Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan. The performance was a great success, and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers. Stravinsky arranged to have Gauthier to premiere all of his vocal pieces. Gauthier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America. Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel, she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him, but also with Erik Satie and Les Six.

{"prefix": "Gauthier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America. Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel, she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him, but also with Erik Satie and Les Six.", "gold": "This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert. She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her, the only exception being a refusal to perform Pierrot Lunaire by Arnold Schoenberg. Through this, Gauthier performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the United States. She also included American music in all of her concerts. Gauthier toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922, and again in 1923. She began to explore Jazz music in concert as well, earning her negative reviews by many musical critics. Her 1923 annual performance at Aeolian Hall entitled \"Recital of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice\" became a historic occasion when she presented the works of George Gershwin, the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert. The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time. She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell, mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Paul Hindemith, Arnold Schoenberg, Arthur Bliss, Darius Milhaud, Maurice Delage, and Swan Hennessy. The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment, however. She opened with Alexander's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin, then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson, and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin: I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise, Innocent Ing\u00e9nue Baby, and Swanee. Gershwin played the piano for these pieces. Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Virgil Thomson, and Paul Whiteman. Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music, the performance was overall a huge success, and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art. Gauthier continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences. On some occasions, such as her performances of Gershwin in New York in 1923 and 1925, as well as in London in 1925, this was quite successful. A critic in Vienna welcomed her musical selection as a reprieve from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert, Brahms, Wolf, Richard Strauss - while praising her skill with more classical choices.

One of the columns was a fashion report; the other, entitled \"Is Paris Burning?\", was a report on the cultural life of Paris, particularly the lives of Satie, Les Six, and their circle. These columns were written from the point of view of a North American who was intensely fascinated by Parisian culture. In these columns, she also wrote about the rise of surrealism in art and theatre, which led to her close collaboration with the leaders of the movement, notably Breton and \u00c9luard.

{"prefix": "Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which can be attributed to its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.

Stuckle in 1874, who was surveying the mountain as part of the Hayden Survey. Originally measured as in height, Mount Elbert's elevation was later adjusted to following a re-evaluation of mapped elevations, which sparked protests. The actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the North American Vertical Datum of 1988; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level Datum of 1929. A matter of some contention arose after the Great Depression over the heights of Elbert and its neighbor Mount Massive, which differ in elevation by only . This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height, only to have the Mount Elbert proponents demolish them. The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount Elbert has remained the highest peak in Colorado. The first motorized ascent of Elbert occurred in 1949, when a Jeep was driven to the summit, apparently to judge suitability for skiing development.

The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA).", "gold": "The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions. In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident. A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The idea of \"no independence before majority rule\" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia's government was dominated by the country's white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally. Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia. Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism\u2013Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the \"Second Chimurenga\" against the Rhodesian government and security forces. The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour. The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU. Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a d\u00e9tente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup. Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976.", "text1": " By this time, nearly every Matabeleland and Matebele township had been completely destroyed.

The southern half of the country, around Salisbury, was under increasing threat from the ZIPRA forces in Matabeleland. Another form of rebellion was the often violent reaction of Black Rhodesians, including Rhodesian blacks, against the illegal Rhodesian Front (RF) government. [13] Fearing their intervention, on 25 June, Smith announced a cease-fire. In September 1976, 19 students at the University of Rhodesia were expelled and later arrested, apparently for protesting Smith's government. FZP also had a good deal of influence in the multiracial Coloured Representative Council (CRC). They had limited military resources at their disposal, and the majority of military strikes were mounted by dissident groups based in neighboring countries.

For others, far from our borders, it is an intellectual matter, not one which affects them deeply. Here is the tragedy!\" The talks between Smith and the ZAPU leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by Salisbury. Smith himself called Nkomo a \"monster\". Cilliers comments that the ending of the Smith\u2013Nkomo talks at this time was \"potentially the most serious result of the Viscount massacre\", as the talks had been progressing well before the incident. He surmises that an agreement between the two \"at this critical stage\" might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition. On 10 September, the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law, which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed. He declared Rhodesia's intent to \"liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism\", and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for \"any defensive strikes we might undertake\" against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front. William Irvine, the co-Minister of Transport, warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia \"w[ould] not let these innocents go unavenged\". Because ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia, many Rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country, but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around Chimoio in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during Operation Dingo, destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called \"New Chimoio\", slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals. In a combined airborne-ground assault called Operation Snoopy, the Rhodesian Air Force, Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978. Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA's aid in the form of nine Soviet-made T-54 tanks and four Russian BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers, but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces.", "text1": " See more\nWe are not!

Like Matthew\u2019s account in chapter twenty-seven that features women at Calvary (something that other evangelists do not have) this new frame of the events offer us an invitation to meditate about women in the story.

The Matthew gospel, in its time as most probably the first to be gathered after the events took place, in its first written edition, makes women present in the end, in the act, in the drama in the story. When all hope is given up and everyone is silent, in Matthew\u2019s account, it\u2019s the women who remain on the edge, at Calvary. The Romans make sure the disciples run for home; the disciples try to be invisible.

Matthew includes what we have heard in the Passion narrative. We will understand the reasoning behind this addition. The unique addition of women at Calvary in Matthew's account prompts us to reflect on their role in the story. Both of these are connected. Ultimately, the presence of women in the story is significant because their experiences and roles matter. Matthew's gospel, likely the earliest written account after the events, includes women in the Crucifixion narrative. In Matthew's version of the Crucifixion, the women are the ones who stay by the cross when everyone else has lost hope and fallen silent.

Some of the Natives, including Joe Warbrick, accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy, claiming that they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players. The Natives remained in London following the England international. They defeated London Welsh on 18 February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford University. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After a win over Runcorn, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground Eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous.

The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain. They eventually played Southern Counties, and beat them 3\u20131. This was their 74th match in the British Isles and their 49th victory. The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell.

In developing Fringe, the co-creators did not want to make the series too serialized, as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams' television series Alias. They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content, and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration.

The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they \"drilled out the eyeball and sculpt[ed] it open and [went] through a series of molds.\" Stanley stated that \"it's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me, even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out.\" The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a \"photon gun\"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons. VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye's last vision, they used \"a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location,\" which they then used to \"take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab.\" \"The Same Old Story\" featured guest appearances by actors Derek Cecil as Christopher Penrose and Mark Blum as his father, Dr. Claus Penrose.", "text1": " Olivia wants to know why Peter would have been covered up like that.

In 2000, producer David Heyman asked Radcliffe to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling book by British author J. K. Rowling. Rowling had been searching for an unknown British actor to personify the character, and the film's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, \"This is what I want. This is Harry Potter\" after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield. Eight months later, following several auditions, Radcliffe was selected to play the part. Rowling endorsed the selection, saying: \"I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\" Radcliffe's parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two-film contract with shooting in the UK; Radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would act in more than two Harry Potter films. The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone took place in 2001. Radcliffe received a seven-figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was \"not that important\" to him; his parents chose to invest the money for him. The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews, and critics took notice of Radcliffe: \"Radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader's imagination. It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing,\" wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle. A year later, Radcliffe starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second instalment of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarising opinions on the film overall. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was criticised by The New York Times film critic A. O.

The committee concluded that the allegation was not \"appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research misconduct\". In a 2005 interview in The Rocky Mountain News, Churchill said, \"I have never been confirmed as having one-quarter blood, and never said I was. And even if [the critics] are absolutely right, what does that have to do with this issue? I have never claimed to be goddamned Sitting Bull.\" The longtime indigenous activist Russell Means said in February of that year, \"So I want, from this day forward, every media person nationally, internationally and locally to know that we have ascertained that Ward Churchill is a full-blooded Indian leader.\" Churchill has responded to requests for verification of his asserted Indian heritage in various ways, including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native American tribes establish their membership requirements. Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency. For decades in his writings, Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose. He says, Set the blood quantum at one-quarter, hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians, let intermarriage proceed as it [has] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence. Churchill's assertions have been raised as one of the several research-misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 (see below). He has been accused of using his interpretation of the Dawes Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member. Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture, and what he describes as the genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the Americas by European-American settlers and the ongoing repression of native peoples. According to the University of Colorado investigation, \"His academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and reinterpretation, drawing upon studies by other scholars, not monographs describing new research based on primary sources.\"", "text1": " Churchill writes that \"Americans are the sons and daughters of slaves and slaveholders. Our national consciousness has been shaped by centuries of subjugation and rebellion, of slavery and segregation, of violence and resistance.\" Native Americans responded to this assertion by stating that Native Americans could not have existed in the colonies at that time because they had all been killed by the Europeans.

The planet orbits the solar analog star, Upsilon Andromedae A, approximately every five days.", "gold": "Discovered in June 1996 by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler, it was one of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered. It is also one of the first non-resolved planets to be detected directly. Upsilon Andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Saffar for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Vega Astronomy Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al-Saffar of Muslim Spain. Upsilon Andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of Upsilon Andromedae's spectrum. The planet's existence was announced in January 1997, together with 55 Cancri b and the planet orbiting Tau Bo\u00f6tis. Like 51 Pegasi b, the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star, Upsilon Andromedae b orbits very close to its star, closer than Mercury does to our Sun. The planet takes 4.617 days to complete an orbit, with a semimajor axis of 0.0595 AU. A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found. The true mass may be much greater depending on the inclination of the orbit. A mass of and an inclination of 24\u00b0 were later found using high-resolution spectroscopy. Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface.", "text1": " Upsilon Andromedae b is a \"hot Jupiter\", with a mass about 1.2 times that of Jupiter and a diameter about 95% larger. The planet is estimated to have a temperature of 1,350\u00a0K (1,080\u00a0\u00b0C), or 1,620\u00a0K (1,350\u00a0\u00b0C) if it were tidally locked. It was discovered in 1996 by a team led by Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, using the wobble technique, and was the first extrasolar planet found around a Sun-like star.\nUpsilon Andromedae b orbits its star \u00a0at an average distance of 0.0591 AU and has an eccentricity of 0.043, in 4.6176 days. If viewed from a distance, the orbit would be a circle around the star with a minor deviation in the shape of an ellipse. It orbits in a retrograde direction, which means it orbits in the opposite direction from the planet's rotation. The planet's orbital plane is inclined 30.2\u00b0 to the Earth's line of sight, which means that its orbit can be seen from Earth. Upsilon Andromedae b was the first planet discovered to orbit a star outside our Solar System in the same direction as the planets in our Solar System.", "text2": " With an orbit as tight and a temperature of nearly 2000 K \u2013 more than twice the temperature of the Sun at its hottest point, this puts it far closer in comparison to the scorching inner planets of our own solar system: Mercury, Venus and Mars.\u00a0Upsilon Andromedae b was discovered using a technique called radial-velocity measurements in late 1996.\nDiscovered in late 1996, the outer planet was found by Michael Butler with a team of astronomers working under Georgi Mandushev at San Diego State University (Woolf and Newman 2004; Woolf et\u00a0 al. 2005).\nIt was found to be in an elliptically shaped orbit with a period of only 241 days. The discovery was an important one because it made the system the first known multi-planetary star system, and also the first star system with more planets closer in to the parent star than Earth is to the Sun.\nIsolated discoveries were made more or less at about the same time. Team members were deeply invested in the discovery, the first with a group led by Georgi Mandushev at San Diego State and a co-discovery by a team led by Peter Butler in Australia.\nThese planetary companions, in the context of their host star\u2019s ultrahot mid-F subgiant status and their orbital architecture, add to the already amazing diversity of architectures of systems found to host several massive companions.", "text3": "Its tight orbit and temperature of nearly 2000 K make it comparable to the scorching inner planets of our solar system: Mercury, Venus, and Mars.

One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan.

They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270 km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports (Prome, Dala and Bassein), the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome.

The flight took off from Kariba Airport on schedule soon after 17:00 Central Africa Time. Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain John Hood, a native of Bulawayo who had gained his commercial pilot licence in 1966. He had flown Viscounts for Air Rhodesia since 1968, and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force on a voluntary basis. His first officer, Garth Beaumont, was 31 years old, and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life, having immigrated as a child from South Africa. The two air stewardesses were Dulcie Esterhuizen, 21 years old and from Bulawayo, and 23-year-old Louise Pearson, from Salisbury. A group of ZIPRA guerrillas, armed with a Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly. At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash. \"We're going in,\" he radioed. Telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of Karoi, intending to belly land the craft.

Those remaining would be crossing the border by means of small fast inflatable rafts. The local guerrilla commanders were becoming increasingly desperate. Some of them resorted to bringing along their families and anyone else that wanted to make the journey in exchange for the pay-off that would secure a safe passage to their final destination. All this was to no avail as the Rhodesian forces still held the Zambian territory between Kanyemba Landing and the Zambezi river and would block any attempts at crossing.\nThe sea or river boat ambush would go down as one of the most successful actions carried out by the Rhodesian Light Infantry or RLI.", "text2": " Kariba boasted both two international class hotels as well as Rhodes' finest game lodges, including popular drinking and eating places like \"Little Shilling\", and many guest farms - which would cater for white farmers and their families taking holidays in Rhodes' bush country, and for weekenders in the country, who would enjoy a change of atmosphere from life in the city (Salisbury).

He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code. Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty. Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier.

The larger one is the \"crusher\", and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the \"cutter\", which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. Usually, the left claw is the crusher, and the right is the cutter. The exoskeleton is generally blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment. The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap. The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics: The rostrum of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in H. gammarus. The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red-tipped, while those of H. gammarus are white or white-tipped. The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red, while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red. Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size. Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female, whose shell is therefore soft, and a hard-shelled male. The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months, depending on the temperature, attached to her pleopods. Females carrying eggs are said to be \"berried\" and can be found throughout the year. The eggs hatch at night, and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15\u201335 days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a benthic lifestyle.", "text1": " Lobsters pass through several morphological stages known as instars; each time a lobster sheds its exoskeleton, its body increases in overall size and turns a whiter color; this interval is known as a moult. A lobster is soft or newly moulted when it is a paler color, similar to the flesh color of many prawns. At this stage, the lobster is relatively tender and not fit for cooking, because if cooked, it will have a hard and rubbery texture. It can take two to eight days for a newly moulted lobster to change to its full adult coloration; these lobsters are very vulnerable to predation.\nAbout the Lobster\nThis little beauty is known as an \u2018unusual\u2019 coloured lobster, not a pure white, but red or even orange-red. It is caused by the female lobster injecting the eggs with the red pigment, astaxanthin. This pigment is only found in red lobsters and gives them a pinkish to orange-red colour, though they are not albino lobsters (no pink spots). Scientists have no definite answer as to why this happens. It is a sign of a healthy lobster and they are rare, but have no connection to the flavour or nutritional value of the lobster. If it was to affect the price of the lobster it would be sold at the same rate as a pure white lobster and treated the same way, no problem with that!", "text2": " Although\u00a0 molting \u00a0can occur in lobsters at any point of their lifecycle, lobster catch often peaks in the fall when lobsters carry on this activity\u00a0 en masse, a phenomenon called molting migrations.\nWhile ecdysis occurs in other crustaceans (such as\u00a0crabs,\u00a0krill or shrimp) it can be dramatic for larger lobsters such as the\u00a0 American lobster. A lobster\u2019s exoskeleton hardens immediately after\u00a0 molting, making it vulnerable. Although some lobsters die during ecdysis, the survivors will quickly hide themselves, while also drawing much less to the predators.\u00a0Many of them stay hidden underwater for up to two days before coming out and for a certain amount of time after that, the lobsters can only partially withdraw their eyes. While in this vulnerable state, predators can feed on lobsters if caught and their chances for evading capture drops dramatically.\u00a0After two years, some lobsters have grown to the size and weight at which point it can no longer molt, making it vulnerable. Lobsters can move between different types of habitat including shallow and deep, sandy or rocky. They tend to stay below the sublittoral boundary in summer and feed on eel-grasses, gastropod and polychaetes on the muddy floor, but may visit rocky bottoms and swim at night in summer.", "text3": "Lobsters can molt at any time, but their peak molting activity in the fall is known as molting migrations. Larger lobsters like the American lobster can have a particularly dramatic ecdysis compared to other crustaceans. After molting, a lobster's exoskeleton quickly becomes tough again, leaving it susceptible to harm. Surviving lobsters quickly hide after molting, making themselves less noticeable to predators. Lobsters often remain concealed underwater for a couple of days before emerging, during which time they can only partially retract their eyes. Predators have a higher chance of catching and feeding on lobsters when they are vulnerable after molting, making it harder for them to escape. After two years, certain lobsters reach a size and weight that prevents them from molting, leaving them susceptible to harm. Lobsters have the ability to transition between various habitats, such as shallow or deep waters, sandy or rocky areas.

In fact, with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook, the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring, neither one knowing that the others have done likewise. The humor in this piece centers around this pie. What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination. Imagine eight people, not to speak of the cat, getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie! ...

The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation. ... A weak point in the story is the fact that the pie is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power. Two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing.

From 1788 until 1870 the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces. Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service, known as the New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804. Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion, a coup mounted by its officers in 1808. As a result, in January 1810 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By 1870, 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units. Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack, no actual threat ever materialised. The British Army was instead used in policing, guarding convicts at penal institutions, combating bushranging, putting down convict rebellions\u2014as occurred at Bathurst in 1830\u2014and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement. Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 on the Victorian goldfields. Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan. During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by units detached by the Royal Navy's Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, based in Sydney. However, in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a commodore, marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia. The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913, when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy; the Royal Navy's depots, dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people.", "text1": " Yet Australia has also consistently sought to maintain a low public profile, viewing its security with a sense of caution and ambivalence. To the extent that it engages in the international arena, Australia has a dual identity of belligerent and bystander. And it has sought to address the problems of its immediate neighbourhood with an almost Boy Scout\u2019s mentality, often championing issues such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nAustralia has, of course, frequently been a part of international coalitions, not least during the Second World War, the Korean War, and the Gulf Wars, and today it is a founding member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, a participant in the East Asian Summit and the Western Pacific Naval Symposium, and a member of the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission. Yet it has also been heavily invested in the creation of the \u2018NATO\u2019 of the Asia-Pacific \u2013 the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and the Australian New Zealand United States Security Treaty (ANZUS) \u2013 neither of which has survived the rapid changes in the region. And in 2005, it was very slow in agreeing to participate in the United Nations stabilisation effort in East Timor (now Timor-Leste). So while Australia has been a major force in responding to international crises, it has also displayed what can only be described as a period of blindness when it comes to certain crises and particularly, its own.", "text2": " Now though a more focused and clear-eyed national security policy might turn Australia's focus onto those closer threats. Indeed the Australian Defence Force's Report on the New Generation Weapons, co-ordinated by David Gordon, makes the prediction that non-state groups and proxies will now be likely to engage in asymmetrical attacks more often than states.\nThese would represent an extension of the threat posed by local insurgent groups (such as the PIRA in Northern Ireland, or the Shining Path in Peru) or terror groups (such as the Harkats in the late-1990's) which we have already become adept at combating through increased resources for our intelligence community and police. However, whereas before these forms of terrorist activity were mostly targeted at military personnel (which is after all what they are), the threat posed by some of the rogue state proxies may be more focused against civilian targets. Examples of rogue states involved in supporting non-state group proxies include Iraq's support of the PLF and AMIS, and Pakistan's support of the Kashmir mujahadeens. Whilst both countries clearly had legitimate national security and strategic interests in supporting these operations, such actions have been in part criticised for involving support for 'terrorist groups'. Therefore, a prime Australian national security strategy for defending the country against such threats may need to involve increasing the country's counter-insurgency capabilities in preparing and supporting police and paramilitary units in thwarting such rogue state supported proxy insurgent campaigns.", "text3": "A more focused and clear national security policy could shift Australia's attention to closer threats.

Chak Tok Ich'aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis. Little is known about Chak Tok Ich'aak except that he was killed on 14 January 378 AD. On the same day, Siyah K\u2019ak' (Fire Is Born) arrived from the west, having passed through El Peru, a site to the west of Tikal, on 8 January. On Stela 31 he is named as \"Lord of the West\". Siyah K\u2019ak' was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non-Maya hieroglyph of a spearthrower combined with an owl, a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. Spearthrower Owl may even have been the ruler of Teotihuacan. These recorded events strongly suggest that Siyah K\u2019ak' led a Teotihuacan invasion that defeated the native Tikal king, who was captured and immediately executed. Siyah K'ak' appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at Tikal itself; roughly at the time of the conquest, a group of Teotihuacan natives were apparently residing near the Lost World complex. He also exerted control over other cities in the area, including Uaxactun, where he became king, but did not take the throne of Tikal for himself. Within a year, the son of Spearthrower Owl by the name of Yax Nuun Ayiin I (First Crocodile) had been installed as the fifteenth king of Tikal while he was still a boy, being enthroned on 13 September 379. He reigned for 47 years as king of Tikal, and remained a vassal of Siyah K'ak' for as long as the latter lived. It seems likely that Yax Nuun Ayiin I took a wife from the preexisting, defeated, Tikal dynasty and thus legitimized the right to rule of his son, Siyaj Chan K'awiil II.", "text1": " The most important lowland ceremonial center during the Classic period was Yaxha, where archaeological research has revealed an earthen pyramid over 150 feet high, the highest known in the region. (The main pyramid at Tikal is 235 feet.) Another major center was Nakum, a stone enclosure more than 200 feet wide. These archaeological finds and more would give researchers a better idea of the Mayan city-states' role in the region. The Mayans of the Maya Highlands were the original Maya, and their culture is sometimes called the Olmec culture because of the similarity of monuments and religious objects. In 850, Tikal fell into decline and was no longer a major power in the area. There are known to have been over 100 of these throughout the Maya area, but most of the great cities were built on the periphery of the jungle, in low-lying areas with fertile soil. Nohmul was the southernmost site in this Maya lowlands network. The Classic Maya civilization lasted from about 250 AD to 900 AD, and its ruins are scattered across Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. Lowland cities flourished, and monumental construction was made possible by an agricultural surplus. Cities arose across the Yucat\u00e1n and down the coast to Honduras.

After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary. Off-site, the new brake wheel and fantail were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast-iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly. The fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began.

Including Alaska and Hawaii, Mount Elbert is the fourteenth-highest mountain in the United States. Weather conditions often change rapidly, and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summertime; hailstorms and snow are possible year-round. An electrical storm on the mountain's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the July 1894 issue of Science. Mount Elbert is part of the Sawatch Range, an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which separated from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily glaciated, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of Elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded, which lie on a lateral moraine. Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam. Mount Elbert is composed largely of quartzite. However, the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock, which is Pre-Cambrian in origin and about 1.7 billion years old. There are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite, as well as bands of gneiss and schist. Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which can be attributed to its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.", "text1": " This is due to the South Maroon Peak Trail being the shortest route, or shortest trailhead to peak, of the four routes to the summit. Once you reach the ridge crest it's time to turn westward towards the summit. As you reach the summit you'll likely be in the clouds, but you'll want to take a few moments to look back at what you just did to get to this place. The views back are incredible. Mount Silliman summit is just a short walk away and one you will not want to miss. View a list of designated mountain goats when they are recorded and if any are tagged.

Along with Lauderdale County and the city of Marion, Meridian is served by the East Mississippi Business Development Corporation, which was formed in 1996 by a group of business leaders from the area. While as of April 2010, the city's civilian labor force was only 15,420 people, there is a population of 232,900 in a radius and 526,500 in a radius, of which 104,600 and 234,200 people respectively are in the labor force. The city thus serves as a hub of employment, retail, health care, and culture activities. Eighty percent of Lauderdale County's workers reside in the county while 90% live within 45 miles. In April 2020, there were 5,101 people employed in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Health Systems is the largest healthcare organization in the region, employing 2,465 people, followed by Anderson Regional Health System with 1,343 and East Mississippi State Hospital with 943. There are two hospitals in Meridian, as well as many other healthcare-related facilities. Anderson Regional Medical Center provides cardiovascular surgery, a Level II newborn intensive-care unit, and a health and fitness center. In December 2010, Anderson bought Riley Hospital and absorbed its employees and stroke treatment center and rehabilitation services. Rush Foundation Hospital and the related Rush Health Systems operate a Specialty Hospital of Meridian, which offers long-term care for non-permanent patients who require more recovery time in a hospital setting. Other healthcare facilities in Meridian include the Alliance Health Center and East Mississippi State Hospital, the latter of which has been in operation since 1882. Retail is another major employer in the county, with 5,280 people employed in April 2010. Nearly $2 billion annually is spent on retail purchases in the city. The Uptown Meridian offers over one hundred shopping venues, including department stores, specialty shops, restaurants, eateries, and United Artists Theatres. Phase I of the construction of Meridian Crossroads, a shopping center in the Bonita Lakes area, was completed in November 2007, providing a major boost to retail in the area. Also, the shopping district on North Hills Street has continued to expand, and in March 2007, additional retail and office space was opened near the Highway 19 Walmart Supercenter.

When the railroads and rail industry were well established, the area was the center of the booming economy of the city.\nIn addition, the city had three rail yards, five large grain elevators, and the Union Stockyards, the largest in the nation at that time, which enabled it to supply a growing meat packing industry and its associated meat plants. The Kansas City Stockyards Company was the most significant meat packing company in Kansas City. In 1930 it sold $67,784,350 worth of livestock, $61,648,325 worth of meats, and employed 22,283 people. The livestock and the meat products of the meat plants of Kansas City became a staple in the diets of people of the central United States.\nLike other American rail centers, however, Kansas City's rail economy slowed in the 1930s and nearly ground to a halt by the end of World War II. The railroad itself accounted for only 15,450 jobs and $30 million of the city's $74 million in 1946 wages. Railroads were not part of the city's economy by the 1970s.

{"prefix": "After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory. By the 7th century, there was no active Teotihuacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had been razed by 700.", "gold": "Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style. Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today. In 738, Quirigu\u00e1, a vassal of Cop\u00e1n, Tikal's key ally in the south, switched allegiance to Calakmul, defeated Cop\u00e1n and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Cop\u00e1n. In the 8th century, the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis. By the late 8th century and early 9th century, activity at Tikal slowed. Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers. By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence.", "text1": " Our final stop on the archaeological circuit of Mesoamerica is at the site of Calakmul, the other great Classic Period city-state in the Pet\u00e9n Basin.

The Maya civilization extended throughout Mesoamerica from Honduras in the east to the central coast of Mexico in the west.

The 9th century marked the nadir of Maya history as the population had fallen to perhaps only 1% of its peak numbers in the 9th century.

A third bridge added to the NRHP in late 2012 has not been added to MDOT's listing however. The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River, which has since been bypassed by a new bridge. The original structure, dating to 1918, is a spandrel arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. 191. The structure was listed on the NRHP on December 9, 1999, for its architectural and engineering significance. In December 2012, the National Park Service approved the listing of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the Menominee River northwest of Iron Mountain. The structure is a single-span, pin-connected, camelback, through-truss bridge, and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan. It was built between 1909 and 1910 because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing. The span cost $5,106 (equivalent to $ in ), paid equally by Dickinson and Florence counties. Until the 1930s, the Upper Twin Falls Bridge carried US 2 across the Menominee River. In 1934, a new bridge was built about a mile downstream, and the highway was rerouted over the new span. The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September 1971, and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012. In 2003, MDOT replaced the Sturgeon River Bridge in Waucedah Township, Dickinson County. , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced, MDOT retained it on their historic bridge list.

Built as a part of a raceway flume on the river, the water level is actually higher than the road surface. This produces a siphon effect, giving the bridge its nickname.

Nosek and three friends had come to attend the concert from Vrchlab\u00ed, a town in mountains some northeast of Prague. They described Nosek as a huge fan of Lamb of God who had been able to secure an autograph from a guitar player before the concert had started. Nosek's friend Jan Jebav\u00fd testified that Nosek climbed the stage, and as he turned around towards the crowd he was pushed by Blythe off the stage. He said he was \"100% sure Blythe pushed Nosek with both hands.\" He further said that Blythe's behavior deviated from all the concerts he had attended in the past, commenting that Blythe was visibly furious. He further claimed that Nosek was not the first person to be chased off the stage by Blythe, with another fan being kicked, choked and receiving a punch from Blythe. Jebav\u00fd corroborated Blythe's testimony that Blythe asked \"Are you okay?\" after Nosek fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply. However, as Nosek fell sick after the concert, they called him an ambulance. According to Jebav\u00fd, the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it. Nosek's other friend Ond\u0159ej Vlach testified that Nosek's fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle.", "text1": " The boy's mother stated that the injuries were similar to those she suffered when a door slammed shut on her.\nThe defense contends that the injuries to Nosek's face were self-inflicted.

{"prefix": "Three hours after classification, the depression strengthened Tropical Storm Beatriz, the second named storm of the season. Early on June 20, convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops (denoted by cloud-top temperatures below ) appearing on satellite imagery.", "gold": "A notable increase in southerly outflow also took place. As the subtropical ridge north of the storm weakened, Beatriz acquired a more northerly component to its track, bringing the center of the storm closer to Mexico. Convective bands gradually wrapped around the system throughout the day. During the afternoon hours of June 20, a hurricane hunter aircraft found Beatriz just below hurricane strength, and subsequently, the system was upgraded just a few hours later, while situated roughly 85 mi (140 km) southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. Early on June 21, a wide eye developed within the central dense overcast. In light of this, the National Hurricane Center estimated Beatriz to have attained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) along with a barometric pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg); however, it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of 105 mph (165 km/h) from the University of Wisconsin and the Satellite Analysis Branch. Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi (20 km) south-southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico. Centered just off the coast of Mexico, the system interacted with land and began weakening. Hours later, convection rapidly diminished as dry air became entrained in the circulation. In response to quick degradation of the system's structure, the NHC downgraded Beatriz to a tropical storm. Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours, the storm no longer had a defined circulation. Lacking an organized center and deep convection, the final advisory was issued on Beatriz. The storm's remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly 175 mi (280 km) southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Following the classification of Tropical Depression Two-E on June 19, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for coastal areas between Zihuatanejo and Manzanillo. A hurricane watch was also put in place from Tecp\u00e1n de Galeana to Punta San Telmo.

The video for \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was directed by Meiert Avis and produced by Michael Hamlyn and Ben Dossett. The band attracted over 1,000 people during the video's filming, which took place on the rooftop of a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles on 27 March 1987. The band's performance on a rooftop in a public place was a reference to the Beatles' final concert, as depicted in the film Let It Be. During the shoot U2 played an eight-song set, which included four performances of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". Prior to filming, a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be intruded by a group of fans. A backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator, which happened during filming. The depiction of the police attempting to shut down the filming due to safety concerns actually happened during filming, just as seen in the video. Hamlyn was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police. According to Avis, the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day \"almost in real time\", and that \"getting busted was an integral part of the plan.\" Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to dramatize the music video, but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video. In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel, which was rebuilt to create some interest, in case no one showed up at the film shoot.

He was buried in Ashland, Ohio. The secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days. At the time, Punch stated that Richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident, though it is unlikely that Richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months. Ten days after his death, on August 23, the Richmond family held a press conference to reveal that Richmond died from complications from AIDS, which he acquired from an unknown woman. Richmond's physician, Dr. David Dodson, said: \"There's no way of knowing who that woman was. Tim was a celebrity with a lot of charisma, a handsome guy. He naturally attracted a lot of women.\" Punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and personnel underwent HIV testing in the wake of Richmond's death. In 1990, a few months after Richmond's death, Washington television station WJLA-TV and reporter Roberta Baskin reported that Dr. Forest Tennant, who was then the National Football League's drug adviser, \"falsified drug tests\" that ultimately helped shorten Richmond's NASCAR career. Baskin reported that sealed court documents and interviews showed Tennant and NASCAR used \"allegedly false drug-test results in 1988 to bar Richmond from racing\". Baskin also stated that NASCAR had targeted Richmond, requesting that Tennant establish a substance-abuse policy with Richmond in mind.

He was opposed by a powerful political machine, known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks. The Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated the Club's relatively-obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. Flem D. Sampson, the Club's nominee in the Republican primary, won his party's nomination. In the general election, Beckham could not secure the support of Democratic Governor William J.

Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, Beckham lost to Sampson by more than 32,000 votes, with voting fraud suspected but never proved. It was estimated that the Club spent over $500,000 to defeat him. Beckham was expected to be the Democrats' nominee for governor in 1935, but the death of his son in late 1934 had left him distraught, and his wife was opposed to another campaign. The Democrats turned to A. B. \"Happy\" Chandler, of Henderson, who won the election. Beckham supported Chandler's bid, and in return, Chandler appointed him to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in 1936. Beckham also served on the Department of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government Reorganization Commission. Beckham attempted to return to the Senate in 1936. The head of the Jockey Club, James B. Brown, had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930. In 1933, Beckham's ally, Bingham, had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James's, in London, increasing his prominence and his influence. Beckham also enjoyed the support of the United Mine Workers and Louisville Mayor Neville Miller. The race was complicated, however, by the entry of John Y.

He had agreed to support Chandler's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler's support in his run for the Senate. However, Chandler threw his support to Beckham, and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of Bingham and Chandler, he won 85,000 votes, most of them at Beckham's expense.

However, Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland, and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day, telling Colonel Moultrie, \"I see you are doing very well here, you have no occasion for me, I will go up to the town again.\"", "gold": "Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort's walls with persistent broadside cannonades. This strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions; the structure would quiver, and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering. The exchange continued until around 9:00 pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range. At one point during the battle, the flag Moultrie had designed and raised over the fort was shot down. Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again, holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided. He was credited by Moultrie with reviving the troops' spirits, and later given commendations for bravery. A painting of this event (pictured above) depicts Jasper's actions. Counting casualties, Parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard Bristol, which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to the hull, yards, and rigging.

The following morning, the British, unable to drag the grounded Acteon off the sandbar, set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Patriots in small boats sailed out to the burning ships, and fired some of their cannons at the British ships, took what stores and loot they could, and retreated shortly before the ship's powder magazine exploded. The British did not attempt to take the fort again. Within days of the battle, Charlestonians learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. The British troops were reembarked on their transports, and on July 21 the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in its campaign against New York City.

The Maryland Regiment was the most experienced combat unit on the southern front, having been stationed in the Caribbean for nearly a year and distinguished itself at the Battle of Havana. The timely arrival of the Maryland troops caused Montague to hesitate in his attack; Montague now had an additional 400 troops and at least 25 cannons. Under the cover of cannon fire, the British troops dug saps or trenches toward the fort in an attempt to place guns near the fort's base.\nOn June 29, the British resumed their attack, this time landing more men on the mainland and trying to attack both forts at the same time. This proved disastrous: The fort at Black Mingo Creek was captured by the Maryland troops and the landing of the British soldiers there was repulsed, and the attack on Fort Johnson was equally unsuccessful.

It is revealed that Dr. Claus Penrose (Mark Blum), an expert in progeria, is working to help his son Christopher (Derek Cecil) stay alive, as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome. \"The Same Old Story\" first aired in the United States on September 16, 2008 on Fox.

The episode received mixed reviews from television critics \u2013 reviewers thought it was an improvement from the previous episode but faulted it for containing plot contrivances. A prostitute is abandoned by an unknown man at a hospital, dangerously in labor. She dies as the doctors perform a caesarean section, but the child ages rapidly in minutes, soon dead having aged to the likes of a 90-year-old man. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble), new members of the Fringe division, are called to investigate by division head Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick), believing the case to be part of \"The Pattern\", a string of mysterious incidents. The woman is identified as having recently left a local motel, and Olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder case she and her former partner John Scott were not able to solve. Olivia explains to Peter that their murderer would paralyze his victims, young women, then make an incision along their face to extract a piece of brain material, killing the victim in the process. Walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth, her child having accelerated aging disease. Walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field, and remembers where he stashed his car that contains the related files. Once they are retrieved, Olivia makes a connection to the pituitary gland which controls growth in humans, and informs Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) to monitor recent cases where the victims' pituitary gland has been removed.", "text1": " The episode premiered on the FOX network on September 9, 2008.

Radcliffe's performance was criticised by The New York Times film critic A. O. Scott, who felt that co-star Emma Watson had to carry him with her performance. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and Radcliffe singled out the humour as a reason for the film's creative success. The future of the franchise was put into question when Radcliffe, Watson, and co-star Rupert Grint hesitated to sign on to continue their roles. By March 2007, however, Radcliffe had signed for the final Harry Potter films; his signing put an end to weeks of press \"speculation that he would be denied the role due to his involvement in Equus\", in which he had performed nude onstage. Radcliffe reprised the role of Harry for the fourth time in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007). Radcliffe stated that director David Yates and co-star Imelda Staunton made Order of the Phoenix the \"most fun\" film to work on in the series. His performance earned him several award nominations, and he received the 2008 National Movie Award for \"Best Male Performance.\" Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson left imprints of their hands, feet, and wands in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the series' sixth instalment, was released in July 2009. Radcliffe received nominations for \"Best Male Performance\" and \"Global Superstar\" at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards. For financial and scripting reasons, the last Harry Potter book (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows) was divided into two films that were shot back-to-back. This decision drew criticism from the series' fans, but Radcliffe defended the split, stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. Filming lasted for a year and a half, wrapping up in June 2010. The two-film finale, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 and Part 2, was released in November 2010 and July 2011, respectively.

German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007, but abandoned the initiative a year later, finding insufficient legal grounds. As of 2017, polls suggest that half of Germans supported banning Scientology, while over two-thirds considered Scientology dangerous. Scientology, founded in the early 1950s in the United States by L. Ron Hubbard and today claiming to be represented in 150 countries, has been a very controversial new religious movement. Its stated utopian aim is to \"clear the planet\", to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations. Scientology teaches that the source of people's unhappiness lies in \"engrams\", psychological burdens acquired in the course of painful experiences, which can be cleared through a type of counselling called \"auditing\" made available by the Church of Scientology. The fact that Scientologists have to pay large fees for auditing and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history, with governments classing it as a profit-making enterprise rather than as a religion. Critics maintain that Scientology is \"a business-driven, psychologically manipulative, totalitarian ideology with world-dominating aspirations\", and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for Scientology courses. Scientology has fought innumerable lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion. These efforts have been partly successful \u2013 Scientology has gained recognition as a tax-exempt religious group in a number of countries, most notably in Australia in 1983 and the United States in 1993, and in 2007 won an important case at the European Court of Human Rights, which censured Russia for failing to register Scientology as a religion. The German government has said that it does not consider Scientology a religion, but a \"commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism\" whose \"totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany's democratic society\". Accordingly, the German government has taken a very strong stance against the organization.", "text1": " After Scientology was classified as an \"exempt\" religion in 1957, its tax-exempt status was revoked in 1967.

That week, Pope Paul appointed a new curial Congregation of Bishops to advise the Pope in the appointment of bishops.\nThe Pope wanted to remain as Archbishop of Milan; Paul IV, fearing that Charles-\u00c9douard de Foix, Duke of Gramont might be elected pope, persuaded the French king to release de Foix and he quickly made his way to the conclave.

The report's lead, Don Eron, was quoted as saying \"We found that he [Ward Churchill] did not commit academic misconduct\" and that Colorado University Standing Committee for Research Misconduct's investigation \"that at every step, they either presumed that Churchill was lying or guilty\". The report determined that CU - Boulder used the investigation as an alternative method to fire Ward Churchill after they received public pressure after the revelation of his controversial 9/11 essay. Along with the termination of Phil Mitchell, an untenured history instructor, the report concluded that professors should consider a job at Colorado University as last resort due to its treatment of professors under investigation. 1992, Alfred University awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.

By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence.", "gold": "Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once-great power was little more than a memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem glyph. As Tikal and its hinterland reached peak population, the area suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels. Recent analysis also indicates that the city's freshwater sources became highly contaminated with mercury, phosphate and cyanobacteria leading to the accumulation of toxins. Tikal and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbat\u00fan region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources. In the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much-diminished city of Tikal, as evidenced by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by Jasaw Chan K'awiil II in 869. This was the last monument erected at Tikal before the city finally fell into silence.

For the ancient pre-Hispanic Maya, the water of the river was an extension of their ancestral mother (Lady Earth Caster), and therefore, a divine being that was born from a male deity of the same class (then male deity).

The Maya excelled in various fields such as science, art, mathematics, architecture, and writing, ultimately creating a remarkable culture that endured for centuries. The Mayan civilization originated 200 years prior to the birth of Christ. The Maya, native to Mexico and Central America, developed a written language and shared ancient calendar systems. The Mayan civilization began 200 years before the birth of Christ and was located in Mexico and Central America, where they developed a written language and shared ancient calendar systems. What information do you possess? The Maya are unique in their ability to leave behind remnants of their ancestors' lives, providing insights into their past. They are also distinct in being divided into two groups: the pre-Hispanic Maya and their modern-day descendants, the Maya Indians.

Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made. The long stocks were made from Douglas fir. All timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned. It was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to 20% stronger than a similar stock of solid timber. The timber used was thick and nine laminations were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft.

The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on 30 September 1947, while the CMF was re-raised on 1 July 1948. In the immediate post-war period Australia contributed significant forces to the Allied occupation of Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), which included forces from Australia, Britain, India and New Zealand. At its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade, four warships and three fighter squadrons, totalling 13,500 personnel. The Australian Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in Hiroshima Prefecture. The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949, and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948, forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army. From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion. Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations, although by that time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean peninsula following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The RAAF component consisted of Nos. 76, 77 and 82 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF flying P-51 Mustangs, initially based at Bofu from March 1946, before transferring to Iwakuni in 1948. However, by 1950 only No. 77 Squadron remained in Japan.

{"prefix": "is a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis home video game console. It was released in North America in June 1991 and in PAL regions and Japan the following month.", "gold": "The game features an anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. Robotnik, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the powerful Chaos Emeralds. The gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health, and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button. Development began in 1990 when Sega ordered its developers to create a game featuring a mascot for the company. After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue hedgehog and named themselves \"Sonic Team\" to match their character. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by Super Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by programmer Yuji Naka. Sonic the Hedgehog was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It was also commercially successful, establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. The game has been ported a number of times, and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media. It is often cited as one of the greatest video games of all time.", "text1": " The game is the first in the Sonic the Hedgehog series and introduces Sonic, a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog who can run faster than the speed of sound, as he is set to stop the series' antagonist Doctor Ivo \"Eggman\" Robotnik from stealing the Chaos Emeralds to power a fleet of war machines in his quest for world domination.\nThe gameplay of Sonic the Hedgehog revolves around Sonic moving through levels at high speeds, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies. When Sonic gathers enough speed, he can jump into the air, and execute a spinning attack known as the \"spin dash\" which acts as a charging move when used on the ground. Sonic the Hedgehog is designed to focus on the running and jumping, while the platform game gimmicks like fighting against enemies and grabbing rings are a side product of the main game mechanic. This shift away from the fighting and collectibles of previous games makes Sonic the Hedgehog a very different platformer.\nIn addition to this new gimmick, Sonic also has a tendency to rush towards the camera (especially in the later levels) which can make it very hard to get used to. You are sometimes required to focus on the side instead of the main screen to see where you are going.\nSonic the Hedgehog marks the introduction of a series of special stages. These stages were inspired by the Rainbow Road stages in the Super Mario Kart series. To access these special stages, the player must find the Chaos Emeralds.", "text2": " The gameplay is similar to the first game in the series (which was published in the same year for Master System and Game Gear consoles) but with several additions. The player controls Sonic, a blue-furred \"Super Hypermachine\" hedgehog. The gameplay takes the form of a linear single-route game in the form of the Green Hill Zone from the first game. Along this pathway, Sonic collects gold rings that allow him go to the next level or revert to the previous level, or the player loses a \"life\". As the player advances in the game, Sonic faces more formidable levels with more challenging puzzles to complete to successfully finish the set levels. Sonic the Hedgehog features four collectable items hidden within its levels in the form of Chaos Emeralds (some) which could be used in the sequel as extra lives or for a \"super-speed\" feature and boss monsters.\nThe success of Sonic the Hedgehog and its follow-up convinced Sega to focus heavily on the Sonic series in future Sega console releases. The speed and gameplay, along with the overworld map of each level, were adopted in future titles of the Sonic series. Both the Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog sequel were ported and released for Nintendo's Game Boy console in the same year as the Genesis debut. Sonic the Hedgehog became Sega's best seller ever in the US by surpassing 10 million units in sales since 2007 and is considered to be one of the best video games of the time.", "text3": "The gameplay is reminiscent of the original game in the series, which was released in the same year for Master System and Game Gear consoles. however, with multiple new features.

Sonic gathers gold rings along the path to progress to the next level, go back to the previous level, or lose a life. As Sonic progresses through the game, he encounters increasingly difficult levels with more complex puzzles to solve in order to advance. In Sonic the Hedgehog, players can find Chaos Emeralds hidden throughout the levels that can be used for extra lives or special abilities in the next game. Sega's success with Sonic the Hedgehog and its sequel led to a strong emphasis on the Sonic series in upcoming Sega console releases. Future Sonic games incorporated the fast-paced gameplay and level design seen in the original game.

Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes.", "gold": "As well as a collection of artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple-block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the \"butterfly binding\" (hudie zhuang, ) style, whereby whole-folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double-page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, 2015. Said Charles Aylmer, Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department, \"The binding is so fragile, and the manual so delicate, that until it was digitized, we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it \u2013 despite its undoubted importance to scholars.\" This volume went on to influence colour printing across China, where it paved the way for the later but better-known Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden (Jieziyuan Huazhuan ), and also in Japan, where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in ukiyo-e of the colour woodblock printing process known as . The popularity of the Ten Bamboo Studio Manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late Qing dynasty. Hu also produced the work Ten Bamboo Studio Letter Paper (Shizhuzhai Jianpu, ), a collection of paper samples, which made use of the gonghua stamped embossing technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief. Whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers, it also contained paintings of rocks, people, ritual vessels and other subjects. The book was bound in the \"wrapped back\" (baobei zhuang, ) style, in which the folio pages are folded, stacked, and sewn along the open edges.

Still the advance continued, with the drive to Pretoria in May including more than 3,000 Australians.", "gold": "Johannesburg fell on 30 May, and the Boers withdrew from Pretoria on 3 June. The New South Wales Mounted Rifles and Western Australians saw action again at Diamond Hill on 12 June. Mafeking was relieved on 17 May. Following the defeat of the Afrikaner republics still the Boers held out, forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply. This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the Bushmen's Contingents, with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse-riding and shooting skills, but little military experience. After Federation in 1901, eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa, although they saw little fighting before the war ended. Some Australians later joined local South African irregular units, instead of returning home after discharge. These soldiers were part of the British Army, and were subject to British military discipline. Such units included the Bushveldt Carbineers which gained notoriety as the unit in which Harry \"Breaker\" Morant and Peter Handcock served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes. With the guerrillas requiring supplies, Koos de la Rey lead a force of 3,000 Boers against Brakfontein, on the Elands River in Western Transvaal. The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 Rhodesians. The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties. During the night the defenders dug in, enduring shelling and rifle fire. A relief force was stopped by the Boers, while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved. The siege lasted 11 days, during which more than 1,800 shells were fired into the post. After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders, and not prepared to risk a frontal attack, the Boers eventually retired. The Siege of Elands River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war, with the post finally relieved on 16 August. In response the British adopted counter-insurgency tactics, including a scorched earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops, the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children, and a system of blockhouses and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications. Such measures required considerable expenditure, and caused much bitterness towards the British, however they soon yielded results. By mid-1901, the bulk of the fighting was over, and British mounted units would ride at night to attack Boer farmhouses or encampments, overwhelming them with superior numbers.", "text1": " But by June, when the final attacks began, there were only 750 left.\nForty years later, in a memorial service at the Church of St Michael and All Angels in Oxford, the Bishop of Winchester, Albert Longley, declared: \"Here stands the memorial of St Michael's Ambulance Corps, and we who love this country remember with pride the heroism and unselfishness of this band of young men who, half a century ago, with characteristic daring and thoroughness, sent men in hospital trains from their homes in Australia, through the Arctic winter, to the call of the empire in South Africa.\"\nIn the hours after Prince Philip's death, a memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey, with a thanksgiving service taking place two days later at St George's Chapel, Windsor.

Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto M\u00e9ndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Pet\u00e9n, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s. In 1951, a small airstrip was built at the ruins, which previously could only be reached by several days' travel through the jungle on foot or mule. In 1956 the Tikal project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area. From 1956 through 1970, major archaeological excavations were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania Tikal Project. They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures. Excavations directed by Edwin M. Shook and later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from 1957 to 1969. The Tikal Project recorded over 200 monuments at the site. In 1979, the Guatemalan government began a further archeological project at Tikal, which continued through to 1984.", "text1": " Symptoms of Hg toxicity include skin rashes, sore throat, headache, irritability, fatigue, and insomnia.

The consortium took possession of the mill in November 1979. The first priority was to make the mill as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame. A two-week work-in was held at the end of July and beginning of August 1980. Thirty-three volunteers worked on the mill over the work-in. Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from baulks of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at Bury St Edmunds. On 3 August 1980, the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane, followed by the cap frame and the cast-iron curb sections. New oak joists were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower. The bin floor was removed, apart from one oak main beam which was repairable. A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine, and the oak beam was repaired. New oak joists were fitted, along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused. One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail. Some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the Eastbridge Windpump, which, following its collapse on 19 February 1977, had been re-erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life, Stowmarket. The sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair, brickwork was repaired, and new lintels were made for some of the windows. A tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter. The floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed.

The caldera contains significant ore deposits, and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera. Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. The Trout Creek Mountains are semi-arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range, most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the Trout Creek Mountains.

After two straight second-place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point.

Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \"push\", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left.

{"prefix": "While there have been calls for Scientology to be banned, the Church of Scientology remains legal in Germany and is allowed to operate there. Its precise legal status however is unresolved.", "gold": "Two points are contested: first, whether or not the teachings of Scientology qualify as a \"religion or worldview\" (Religion or Weltanschauung; these are equal before German law), and secondly, whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity; if the latter were the case, this would most likely imply that Scientology would not qualify for protection as a \"religious or worldview community\" (Religions- oder Weltanschauungsgemeinschaft) under Article 4 of the German constitution, which guarantees the freedom of belief, religion and worldview. Status as a \"religious or worldview community\" also affects a broad range of other issues in Germany, such as taxation and freedom of association. The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter, but implicitly assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or worldview community. The Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that Scientology should be viewed as a worldview community. In 1995, the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or worldview community entitled to protection under Article 4 of the German Constitution, although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003. In another 2003 decision, the Administrative Court of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Mannheim said there were no indications that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity. In 2005, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4.1 of the German Constitution, which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate. Many courts have declined to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.

The Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia, with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state. The war remained limited, and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo, although a number of Indonesian seaborne and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur. As part of Australia's continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia, army, naval and airforce units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only. On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help mop up infiltrators from seaborne and airborne incursions at Labis and Pontian, in September and October 1964. Following these raids the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo. During the early phases, British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the Malaysian/Indonesian border, and to protect population centres. However, by the time the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing the border into Kalimantan to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation Claret. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross-border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions. 3 RAR deployed to Borneo in March 1965, and served in Sarawak until the end of July, operating on both sides of the border. The battalion had four major contacts with Indonesian forces and several smaller ones\u2014including at Sungei Koemba, Kindau and Babang during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the Indonesians\u2014as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents. 4 RAR served a less-eventful tour between April and August 1966, and also operated over the border, successfully clashing with the Indonesians on a number of occasions.", "text1": " The yellow wing M is the product of gene w. 1. * Ashy-tailed Wren (Thryorchilus browni) has been reclassified as a subspecies of House Wren (Troglodytes aedon). \u2022 Pale eyed true canary.

Additional critics were the sociologist Thomas Brown, who had been preparing an article on Churchill's work, and the historians R.G. Robertson and Russell Thornton, who said that Churchill had misrepresented their work. In 2005, University of Colorado Boulder administrators ordered an investigation into seven allegations of research misconduct, including three allegations of plagiarism, and four allegations of fabrication or falsification regarding the history of the Dawes Act, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, and repeated claims that smallpox was intentionally spread to Native Americans by John Smith in 1614 and by the United States Army at Fort Clark in 1837. On May 16, 2006 the University released their findings; the Investigative Committee unanimously concluded that Churchill had engaged in \"serious research misconduct\", including falsification, fabrication, and two of the three allegations of plagiarism. The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions. The Standing Committee on Research Misconduct accepted the findings of the Investigative Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed. Churchill's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University's Privilege and Tenure Committee, which found that two of the seven findings of misconduct did not constitute dismissible offenses. Three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year's suspension without pay, while two favored dismissal. On July 24, 2007, the University regents voted seven to two to uphold all seven of the findings of research misconduct, overruling the recommendation of Privilege and Tenure panel that two be dismissed. By a vote of eight to one, the regents determined to fire Churchill. The next day, Churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views. The jury in Churchill's suit for reinstatement weighed the university's claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case.

The Mongols, who probably preferred the situation, did nothing to restore order in the next ten years.", "gold": "In March 1297, they accepted the voluntary submission of King Kyawswa of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan (Bagan). But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in 1300\u201301. Marco Polo reported the first invasions (1277\u201387) in his travelogue, Il Milione. The Burmese referred to the invaders as the Taruk (after the central Asian Turkic troops that largely made up the Mongol invasion army); today, the term Taruk () refers to the Han Chinese instead. King Narathihapate is unkindly remembered in Burmese history as Taruk-Pye Min, (\"the King who Fled from the Taruk\"). In the 13th century, the Pagan Empire, along with the Khmer Empire, was one of the two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia. For much of its history, Pagan's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent Dali Kingdom and its predecessor Nanzhao, both with Dali as their capital city. Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west and at other times with China's Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself. Between the newly conquered Mongol territory and Pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan as well as the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges. The Mongol Empire first arrived at the doorstep of the Pagan Empire in 1252 by invading the Dali Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China. The Mongol armies captured the capital, Dali, on 7 January 1253, and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by 1257. The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song.", "text1": " Then, after twenty years, the man from the Golden Family came.

Shiban\u2019s appointment had also some karmic symmetry. Genghis, a man who had conquered vast expanses of territory in the past, would now be succeeded by his grandson Shiban. According to the Mongol rule of succession, such an event had already been ordained in the early thirteenth century.\nShiban, as it turns out, was a worthy successor. Unlike the previous weak monarchs, he was fearless in battle, which was one of the important criteria to becoming a Great Khan. Upon his arrival in his new kingdom, he first subdued the White Bulgars and then the Volga Bulgars. The latter rebellion was incited by their leader Aratnin and two others. They turned the Volga Bulgars into a vassal state of Shiban.\nBoloyan and Kinchaq, the two leaders, were then arrested and put to death.

The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred. Scientology formulated a \"Clear Germany\" strategy in 1994 \u2013 similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world \u2013 with the long-term aim of transforming German society in line with the Scientological ideal: a non-pluralist society in which Scientology enjoys overriding influence.", "text1": " In 1979 the Federal Minister of the Interior issued a written statement that Scientology was not politically neutral, nor was it a \"religious community\" within the sense of the German Constitution.

{"prefix": "Ohshima stated that \"Sonic\" was chosen because it represented speed. Ideas proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band, giving him vampire fangs, and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna, but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple.", "gold": "Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a hedgehog is and initially proposed a full-scale recreation of the character, but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes. The antagonist ended up being named \"Dr. Eggman\" in Japan and \"Dr. Robotnik\" in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega's American and Japanese divisions. With a satisfying protagonist completed, Sega turned to programmer Yuji Naka, who had impressed them through his work on Phantasy Star and the Genesis port of Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Naka was a fan of Super Mario Bros. but desired something faster, so the game was made to play quickly, which was where he focused most of his effort. Naka explained that the reason he wanted a fast game was that he had ported Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and wanted to work on its movement but found it slow. Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by a team of seven: two programmers, two sound engineers, and three designers, although it began with just Naka and Ohshima. People came onto the team as the need for content increased. After being assigned a project with the code name \"Defeat Mario\", Naka and Ohshima began work, but encountered problems: Ohshima's Rabbit proved hard to program. Catching items and throwing them caused the action's rhythm to break. Naka stated that the rabbit was not suitable for his game engine, and he also wanted the game to be playable with only one button. Hirokazu Yasuhara came onto the team to supervise Naka and Ohshima and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping. The trio came up with the idea of him rolling into a ball. After the hedgehog character was chosen, many characters were redrawn, and the team agreed on the environments' visual complexity, with particular focus on the colors. After this, four people came onto the team to speed development up. Due to the popularity of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic to take over the American market.

Richmond completed 112 laps of the 492-lap event to finish 31st, retiring from the race with engine problems. For the following event, Richmond was hired to drive J.D. Stacy's No. 2 car. In his first race for the team, Richmond earned his first career top 5 finish when he placed fifth at Darlington Raceway. Returning to Pocono, he finished second, before winning his first race on the road course at Riverside, California the following week. Later that season, he earned his first pole position at Bristol. The tour returned to Riverside for the final race of the season where Richmond won his second race, sweeping both events at the track. Benny Parsons said that \"watching Richmond go through the Esses was unbelievable\". For the season, Richmond had twelve top 10s, two wins, and one pole to finish 26th in points. In 1983, Richmond began racing for Raymond Beadle whom he had known before he started racing. He returned to the three-cornered Pocono racetrack, earning his first oval victory. During the season, he accumulated four pole positions (Darlington, Pocono, Charlotte, and Atlanta), one win (Pocono), and fifteen top 10s on his way to finishing tenth in season points.

While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle.

She had previously appeared in Holby City sister show Casualty, and had made an appearance in Holby City fifth series as patient Marianne Lawson. She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin. After a series of three meetings, a year after the birth of her first child, she agreed to assume the role of Kyla, despite being \"nervous about signing such a long contract\", stating: \"I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting. I've loved that one month it's Sahara in Morocco and the next I'm doing a stage play, then it's a six-part telly thing. But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to have to look for a job every couple of weeks. It would be nice just to stay put for a while. If I'm going to be a working mum I'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently. And then Holby came along, so I'm very grateful\". Ayola signed a three-year contract to play Kyla, and described herself as \"very similar\" to her character, speaking positively about her working relationship with co-stars Jaye Jacobs and Sharon D. Clarke, as well as the \"dream\" storylines her character was given. She said of the show: \"I really love Holby and I'm surprised how much. What thrills me about Holby is that you get back what you put in. The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.'

She was not eager to tell her friends that she had been on dialysis. She wanted to have the operation and not talk about it. There was a better way, and Martha found it in her resourcefulness as a journalist. So she did not tell her friends about the dialysis at all. When they asked, Martha was delighted to talk about her holiday, her cat, the work of a couple of new journalists she had mentored at The National. Sometimes a friend would say something and Martha would notice her looking confused. 'I was embarrassed,' Martha said to me later. 'They'd say, \"Your health is going very well, isn't it?\" And I'd have to remember what they were talking about. I didn't always get it right. I felt foolish. It was much easier just not to say anything. I didn't want to burden anyone.' So Martha turned on her own charming demeanor. She turned her attention away from her difficulty, and onto the delight of making friends laugh. And that made a difference.

About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80, perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123. At first light, three U.S. Army P-400 Airacobra fighters from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field, acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey, strafed the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them, with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle.

The Kuma battalion\u2014led by Major Takeshi Mizuno\u2014attacked the southeastern sector of the Lunga perimeter, defended by Marines of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment (3/1). Mizuno's attack started around midnight, with one company attacking through Marine artillery fire and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Marine defenders before being thrown back. Mizuno was killed in the attack. After daybreak, the Marines, believing that the rest of Mizuno's battalion was still in the area, sent forward six light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the Marine lines; four Japanese anti-tank guns destroyed or disabled three of them, and while some of the tanks' crewmen were able to escape the flames, several of them were bayoneted and killed by the Japanese. One tank tumbled down an embankment into the Tenaru River, drowning its crew. At 23:00 on 14 September, the remnants of the Kuma battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the Marine lines, but were repulsed. A final \"weak\" attack by the Kuma unit on the evening of 15 September was also defeated. Oka's unit of about 650 men attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the Lunga perimeter.

The 8th Marines was in position near the top of the ridge on the southern flank. It was then that Watanabe noticed the American army's 3-inch rockets. They were raining down on Watanabe's front lines, and Watanabe could feel the heat of the 3-inch shells over his head. More Americans were attacking the Japanese positions with flamethrowers, and Watanabe knew he could not hold his position.

Early on, the economy depended greatly upon the railroads in the area. The city was the largest in Mississippi around the start of the 20th century, with five major rail lines and 44 trains coming in and out daily. The city's economy not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people.

The city thus serves as a hub of employment, retail, health care, and culture activities. Eighty percent of Lauderdale County's workers reside in the county while 90% live within 45 miles. In April 2020, there were 5,101 people employed in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Health Systems is the largest healthcare organization in the region, employing 2,465 people, followed by Anderson Regional Health System with 1,343 and East Mississippi State Hospital with 943. There are two hospitals in Meridian, as well as many other healthcare-related facilities.

Nodules on her vocal cords were problematic, but they were removed surgically.", "gold": "She later began training under Jacques Bouhy, whom she would later credit for her vocal technique. In 1906, Gauthier was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour. Albani provided a degree of mentorship to Gauthier during the 30-week tour of Canada. Lord Strathcona awarded Gauthier a scholarship in 1906 that allowed her to return to Europe and continue her vocal studies. She returned there and continued both to study and give performances. Her first operatic performance came in 1909 in Pavia, Italy as Mica\u00ebla in Bizet's Carmen. She landed a second operatic role as Mallika in Delibes' Lakm\u00e9, which was being performed by the London Covent Garden opera company. The opera opened in June 1910. Supposedly, Luisa Tetrazzini, the prima donna soprano of the company, feared that Gauthier's voice would outshine her own, and demanded that Gauthier be removed from the opera. The company's director acquiesced to Tetrazzini's demands, informing Gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing. Rather than give in to artistic blackmail, Gauthier quit opera entirely. Disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene, Gauthier departed Europe and travelled to Java. There, she met a Dutch importer and plantation manager named Frans Knoote. Gauthier and Knoote married on May 22, 1911. Gauthier studied the music of Java, and began to include this in her repertoire. Her accompanying pianist was Paul Seelig, who had previously been the conductor for the Kraton of Surakarta, which afforded Gauthier a number of opportunities. On permission of the Javanese court, she studied the gamelan, probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity. While living in Java, Gauthier travelled extensively, giving performances in China, Japan, Singapore, Malaya, Australia, and New Zealand. She remained in Java for four years, but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America, arriving in New York City in the fall of 1914.

The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the profit-making motives of the Natives, and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue. The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home Unions over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB). Following a disputed try in an England\u2013Scotland international match in 1888, the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game, but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote, arguing that they deserved this as they were, they asserted, the senior body, and had the most member clubs. Ireland, Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891, when, following arbitration, the RFU relented and joined the IRFB. The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the Natives on 16 February 1889.

In the age of the auto trail, the roads that later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names. When the original roadways between Ironwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau (UPDB) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927.

The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well. In 1920, the King's International Highway linked Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste.

{"prefix": "Mycena maculata bears some resemblance to M. inclinata, but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and is found in eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M. inclinata.", "gold": "M. inclinata is often confused with the edible M. galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M. galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins. M. polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish-gray. Mycena inclinata is a saprobic fungus, deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches. It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The fruit bodies of Mycena inclinata grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps (especially oak and chestnut) during the spring and autumn. The fungus forms a white, woolly mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves. Occasionally, it can be found growing on a living tree. In eastern North America, it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, Missouri, North Carolina, and New York. It has been found in Oregon, but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast. The range of the fungus also includes Europe, the Canary Islands, North Africa, East Siberia, Japan, Malesia, Turkey, and New Zealand. In a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in Ordu (Turkey), M. inclinata was found to have comparatively high levels of iron (628 mg per kg) and nickel (21.6 mg/kg), measured on a dry weight basis. Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum.

{"prefix": "In 2005, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4.1 of the German Constitution, which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate. Many courts have declined to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand.", "gold": "The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion. Recent years have seen a number of court decisions in Scientology's favour, despite the very widespread negative attitude to Scientology among politicians and the general public. Given the history of Nazism's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s, the present German state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution. The BfV domestic intelligence service (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany's free and democratic order, and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997, as have the Offices for the Protection of the Constitution in a number of German L\u00e4nder. Minister for Family Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance, saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal. The German Church of Scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court. In December 2001, the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the Church of Scientology Berlin as paid informants. The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution. At the federal level, Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti-Scientology legislation.", "text1": " Religious freedom cases in Germany are ultimately decided by the Federal Constitutional Court ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ).\nSvantner's Action [ edit | edit source ]\nOn 5 March 2009, the Regional Court in Chemnitz upheld an earlier decision by the District Court ( Landgericht ) and ordered the Chemnitz police to pay Paul-Gerhard Svantner 5,000 euros in damages. Svantner sued after a traffic control officer pulled him over in August 2007, then searched his vehicle and confiscated his ID, credit card and a thumb drive. The officer's search was prompted by his conviction that the logo on a Scientology emblem resembled that of the Hells Angels biker gang. Svantner, who has a tattoo of a swastika on his left arm, was convicted for wearing the emblem in a public place. Svantner, who had previously been a member of the skinhead Neo-Nazi organization, argued that the emblem was intended to be an anti-Nazi symbol in defiance of his criminal past. The conviction has since been overturned by the Superior Regional Court ( Oberlandesgericht ) in Dresden.\nThe Church of Scientology is viewed with suspicion by much of the German population and the media. The Church has been criticized in the past for its invasive and harassing recruitment methods. Church members have been the subject of hate crimes and anti-Scientology websites have been the targets of threats.", "text2": " The Court found that even if Scientology was established for financial purposes, or if Scientology did not meet members\u2019 religious expectations, the belief in Scientology was entitled to constitutional protection. The Court reasoned that the requirement that religious expression be sincere would extend to religious practices or rituals that the actor regarded as genuine, regardless of the actual quality of the practice or the religious authenticity or sincerity of the actor as determined by an outsider or the group as a whole.\nIn a discussion that has been as hotly-debated as it has been misunderstood in the United States, a group of Italian parliament members has proposed a bill that would declare Scientology, a religion in the United States, a \"sect\" in Italy and restrict its \"radical members\" from offering a \"re-education training course that the group is known to require of even the strongest supporters.\" The bill is faring poorly at best: It has been referred to the Chamber on the Responsibilities of Public Authorities, a committee that has twenty-seven members, and none are Scientologists.\nFor all the handwringing (and lawsuits) the bill was based on the idea that Scientologists are in some way different from adherents of other religions, such as Islam, and would allow the government \"mildly to reduce freedom of religion.\"\nNote: An organization formed to promote Scientology may sue in the US courts on the grounds it, and its programs, are constitutionally protected religious expression under the First Amendment.", "text3": "Please provide a rephrased version of the sentence.

{"prefix": "As a result, he was able to produce some of China's first printed publications in colour, using a block printing technique known as \"assorted block printing\" (douban yinshua, ). This system made use of multiple blocks, each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour.", "gold": "It was a lengthy, painstaking process, requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image. Hu also employed a related form of multiple-block printing called \"set-block printing\" (taoban yinshua, ), which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again. He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing; this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible. In some images, Hu employed a blind embossing technique (known as \"embossed designs\" (gonghua, ) or \"embossed blocks\" (gongban, ), using an uninked, imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper. He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants. This was a relatively new process, having been invented by Hu's contemporary Wu Faxiang, who was also a Nanjing-based publisher. Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book Wisteria Studio Letter Paper (Luoxuan Biangu Jianpu, ), published in 1626. Both Hu and Wu used embossing to create decorative writing papers, the sale of which provided a sideline income for the Ten Bamboo Studio. [[File:Hu Zhengyan - Bamboo in snow 1.PNG|thumbnail|Bamboo in snow from the 'Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy]] Hu's most notable work is the Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy (Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu, ), an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well as a collection of artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting.", "text1": " The Da Tang Xiyu ji (Accounts of the Western Region from the Great Tang Dynasty), printed in 635, was the first multi-coloured block-printed book in China and the earliest known example of full-colour printing anywhere in the world.\nThe term \"colour-printing\" does not refer to the materials or the number of colours used, but rather to the way the image is produced. There are several different ways of producing colour printing, and these can be divided into three main categories. First is printing from multiple blocks, with each block printed on a different colour. Second is printing from a single block with multiple colours, where a special type of woodblock printing is used to print each of the desired colours. Finally, there is the system of printing a black-and-white image and then hand-colouring the pages with pigments.\nWoodblock printing was by far the most popular printing technique used during the Song Dynasty. By 1100, there were already some 250 printing establishments throughout China and the production of woodblock books had surpassed that of cloth printing, though the latter still enjoyed an extremely high prestige. Woodblock printing was an extremely time-consuming process, as each block had to be hand-carved by skilled craftsman. For this reason, only a few select authors and texts were chosen to be block printed.\nBamboo was the preferred medium for printing, though other materials were used, including paper and silk.", "text2": " Only black was carved into each of the blocks and a different colour was applied to the block with a brush after the colour was pressed onto paper. Blocks were designed in the reverse of the intended image to facilitate the printing. While such work was originally practiced in China as part of the printing tradition of monochrome woodcut prints during the late Yuan and Ming Dynasties, the blocks for these xylographic works were reused throughout their lifetimes. The practice in Western nations of producing images in colour was highly developed as part of the Byzantine tradition where illuminated manuscript images of the twelfth and thirteenth century reached a degree of craftsmanship and virtuosity unsurpassed until the seventeenth and eighteenth century European painting tradition. Colour was applied to the illumination manuscript by means of hand illustration after the manuscript itself was produced by hand. Each of the pigments used in the illumination of Byzantium was produced through the complex and costly process known as shell gold, in turn requiring a skilled craftsman to apply the illumination by hand and achieve a high level of accuracy. Each of the pigments applied to the manuscript by hand was mixed with gum to the paste-like state in colour or washes which were applied to the manuscript by means of natural-hair sable brushes or quill brushes, producing sometimes rich colour.", "text3": "Each block was carved with black ink and then a different color was added with a brush before being pressed onto paper. The blocks were created in a way that allowed for the image to be printed in the correct orientation.

In Western nations, the production of colored images was advanced through the Byzantine tradition, with illuminated manuscript images from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries showcasing exceptional craftsmanship and skill that was not surpassed until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in European painting.

He was opposed by a powerful political machine, known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks. The Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated the Club's relatively-obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. Flem D. Sampson, the Club's nominee in the Republican primary, won his party's nomination. In the general election, Beckham could not secure the support of Democratic Governor William J.

Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, Beckham lost to Sampson by more than 32,000 votes, with voting fraud suspected but never proved. It was estimated that the Club spent over $500,000 to defeat him.

Madonna commented that, \"Whenever I make records, I often like the remixes better than the original ones.", "gold": "[...] So I thought, screw that. I'm going to start from that perspective\". She promoted the album at the dance party \"Misshapes\" held at Luke & Leroy's nightclub in Greenwich Village, invited by Junior Sanchez to take over the DJ booth where she mixed \"Hung Up\" with \"Sorry\". Musically, \"Sorry\" is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus. It is set in common time with a moderately fast dance groove tempo of 132 beats per minute. Composed in the key of C minor, Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to G4. It follows the chord progression of E\u2013Cm\u2013A\u2013B during the spoken introduction. It then changes to Fm\u2013Gm-Cm in the chorus, while continuing in A\u2013Cm\u2013A\u2013Fm in the intermediate verses, ultimately ending in repeated lines of \"I've heard it all before\". Lyrically the song has excerpts of different languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew, Hindi, Polish language and Japanese. The song talks about personal empowerment and self-sufficiency, denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like \"Everybody\" (1982), \"Vogue\" (1990) or \"Music\" (2000) which was centered around the subject of music itself. Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix consisted of additional vocals provided by Neil Tennant from the group. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \"Heart\" (1988) for Madonna but never delivered it. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \"Sorry\" is the \"album's strongest track\" and that it is a \"Pet Shop Boys-esque\" song. Vineyard went on to say that it \"...wistfully evokes the sounds of the '80s-era dance clubs that first lofted her toward stardom.\" According to a review in the BBC's Collective, \"New single 'Sorry' states Queen Madge's unapologetic stance, and though the song is wrapped up in relationship sentiment, one cannot help but hear the subtext, perhaps directed at her more savage critics: 'there are more important things than hearing you speak'.\" Alan Braidwood from BBC Music called the song \"lethally catchy\".", "text1": " They make the songs fresh again.

The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949, and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948, forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army. From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion. Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations, although by that time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean peninsula following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The RAAF component consisted of Nos. 76, 77 and 82 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF flying P-51 Mustangs, initially based at Bofu from March 1946, before transferring to Iwakuni in 1948. However, by 1950 only No. 77 Squadron remained in Japan. A total of ten RAN warships served in Japan during this period, including HMA Ships Australia, Hobart, Shropshire, Arunta, Bataan, Culgoa, Murchison, Shoalhaven, Quadrant and Quiberon, while HMAS Ships Manoora, Westralia and Kanimbla also provided support. During the early years of the Cold War, Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations, or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain. The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces, where they were expected to operate with British forces. Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948\u201349 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954.

Unlike most forts for military use, the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built; the wide-open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary. The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men, animals, and equipment. These buildings were on the edges of a parade ground. The post quartermaster, Captain Thomas Swords, was in charge of building Fort Scott's structures, and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie, which had few trees. He had only two bricklayers and three carpenters to rely on, as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform. Wood was available, but the mill was built away, making transport time consuming. Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood, skilled labor and working equipment. Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort's construction. As a result, only one duplex of the five planned officers quarters (four duplexes and post commandant's house) was built by 1844, and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed. In his 1844 inspection of the fort, Colonel George Croghan reported that, in comparison to other frontier forts, he considered Fort Scott \"above average\". Due to the rising tensions that escalated in the Mexican\u2013American War, the US Army redeployed troops to the Southwest. With Fort Scott still uncompleted, officials decided on April 25, 1850, that no more construction would be done there, after eight years and $35,000. By the time it was finished, it was obsolete; three years later, it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western Fort Riley. For the average soldier, life at the fort was \"monotonous\". Until the permanent structures were built, soldiers had to live in tents, which lacked comfort. Aside from a few whiskey peddlers and prostitutes, few civilians lived at the fort. Officers had brought their personal slaves with them, including Captain Swords. The border with Missouri was east of Fort Scott.

A group of five companies of the 6th Regiment, U.S. Infantry arrived in December of 1842, and the next spring, May 2, 1843, the Fort Scott Cantonment officially opened as the 8th Military District.

During the summer of 1985, Rajneesh, along with the rest of the group, sent Sheela out of the country to visit family as they were facing prosecution in Oregon. Sheela left two typed letters for Rajneesh and Turner to read if she went missing. Rajneesh shared a letter with Turner and his investigator that supposedly pointed to the involvement of Rajneesh, Sheela, and Turner's wife. On September 15th, the Rajneesh leadership collaborated with the FBI to disarm individuals involved in the conspiracy. The FBI-led raid resulted in the downfall of the group, leading to the indictment of 14 followers, including a high-level board member and a guard from Golden Temple. In January 1986, Sheela and others were convicted of the conspiracy, marking a historic first in the United States.

Bohn, a prominent local citizen who later served in Congress from 1927 to 1933. In 1929, the residents of Escanaba created a memorial to the veterans of World War I called Memory Lane. The project consisted of elm and maple trees planted along US 2/US 41 west of town. The American Legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers. Later in 1949, the Bessemer Women's Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans. Also called Memory Lane, the group planted 140 elms and 1,840 evergreens, trees and shrubs as a landscaped parkway along of US 2 east of Bessemer.

In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution. At the federal level, Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.

Markowitz's script for Horrible Bosses was sold at auction to New Line Cinema by Ratner's production company Rat Entertainment in 2005 for a six-figure amount. Ratner initially was interested in directing, but became occupied with directing the comedy Tower Heist. Frank Oz and David Dobkin were in talks to direct. Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley rewrote the script in 2010, and the project went into production with Seth Gordon directing. Production designer Shepherd Frankel specifically set out to create distinctly different environments for the three employees and their respective bosses' homes and offices. Nick and Harken's workplace is the \"Comnidyne\" bullpen, which was designed to \"enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower-level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office.\" The design team met with financial strategists and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low-ranking position in a cubicle and aspiring to an office. Costume designer Carol Ramsey worked with Frankel and set decorator Jan Pascale to match Harken's suit to that of the surrounding \"cold grey and blue\" color palette of his office. Harken's home was described as \"equally lacking in warmth\" as the office but more lavishly decorated and \"for show\", including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his \"trophy wife\". Designing Julia's office was described as a \"challenge\", infusing a \"sensual vibe\" into a dental office. Frankel approached the design through Julia's mentality, stating, \"She's a Type A professional at the top of her game, who likes to play cat-and-mouse, so it's a completely controlled environment, with apertures and views into other rooms so she always knows what's going on\". \"It's highly designed, with rich wallpaper and tones, sumptuous artwork and subtle lighting\u2014all very disarming till you step into her private office.", "text1": " Pacing is the film\u2019s greatest asset, moving at a breakneck speed that rarely, if ever, lags.

Beckham voted against it both times. The Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas that those industries were prominent, Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women's vote and by his support of Wilson, who had lost popularity since Beckham's election, in 1914. Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3% of the vote to Beckham's 49.7&%. During his only term in the Senate, Beckham served alongside three other US Senators from Kentucky: Ollie M. James, George B. Martin, and Augustus O. Stanley. After his term in the Senate ended, Beckham resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time, he had the support of the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful political machine, known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks. The Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated the Club's relatively-obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. Flem D. Sampson, the Club's nominee in the Republican primary, won his party's nomination. In the general election, Beckham could not secure the support of Democratic Governor William J. Fields, who had been elected with the help of the Jockey Club. Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, Beckham lost to Sampson by more than 32,000 votes, with voting fraud suspected but never proved. It was estimated that the Club spent over $500,000 to defeat him. Beckham was expected to be the Democrats' nominee for governor in 1935, but the death of his son in late 1934 had left him distraught, and his wife was opposed to another campaign. The Democrats turned to A. B. \"Happy\" Chandler, of Henderson, who won the election.

Route 50 was designated onto its current alignment in 1927, replacing this portion of pre-1927 Route 14. In 1960, a freeway was proposed for Route 50, running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township to US 30 in Mullica Township. This proposal was canceled by the mid-1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic. The interchange between Route 50 and the Atlantic City Expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange, with completion in June 2010. Route 50 begins at an intersection with US 9 in the Seaville section of Upper Township, Cape May County, heading to the north on a two-lane undivided road.

Po\u0159\u00e1dek testified that Blythe knocked him down, knelt on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not choke him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he (Po\u0159\u00e1dek) was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate.

Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of Nosek's fall at the end of the concert.

The vast region surrounding the Irrawaddy valley would continue to be made up of several small Tai-Shan states well into the 16th century. Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the Mongol invasions was the emergence of Tai-Shan states in mainland Southeast Asia. The Tai-Shan people who came down with the Mongol invasions stayed. By the early 14th century, several Tai-Shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present-day Assam to northern and eastern Myanmar to northern and central Thailand and Laos. Their rise was encouraged by the Mongols, who viewed the states as a useful buffer between Yunnan and the rest of Southeast Asia. The Mongols, who were still trying to incorporate Yunnan into the central administration, were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of Yunnan into the fold. (The integration of Yunnan itself into \u201cChina Proper\u201d was to take several more centuries, and continues to today.) As such, from the newly formed Tai-Shan states in western and central Southeast Asia to Dai Viet and Champa in eastern Southeast Asia, the Mongols elected to receive nominal tribute. Though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the Yuan government, they were the native chieftains, \u201cwho would have ruled there in any case, and they did as they pleased.\u201d The war also marked the arrival of China at the doorstep of Burma.

However, the Jurchen/Jin and Song soon fell out and, in 1125, the Jurchen conquered the Song and drove them back to the south. It is in part because of this that the dynastic circle continued, as Song had spent the latter half of the 11th century fighting the Northern Song. Despite the rivalry, these two important states were of course dependent on each other to some degree. Therefore, they did not completely fall out for another three decades.\nIn 1211, the Jin dynasty came under attack by the Mongols who had, at that point, only just unified their own lands.

The letter says:\"If you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the All-Highest, send one of your brothers or senior ministers, to show men that all the world is linked with Us, and enter into a perpetual alliance.

Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI). Australia's role in the Pacific War declined from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there.

He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) \"in recognition of distinguished service in the Borneo Territories\" on 22 June. His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co-operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. He served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971. Returning to Australia in June 1971, Headlam took resettlement leave before retiring from the Air Force on 3 August.", "text1": " Headlam left service as a group captain in June 1964, and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1965.

Crofting is the mainstay of island life. Sheep form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks and geese. Vegetable are grown too, often in the shelter of circular walls, such plots being known as 'planti crubs' - these were originally used to propagate kale (cabbage) seedlings and were built well away from other buildings where they would be safe from mice. The seedlings would then be transplanted to kaleyards (gardens) near the houses. Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale. There is a post office at the pier, but no shop.

The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. The crossing takes 45 minutes, and although the Snolda carries cars, there is only one short road on the island. For visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care. There is an airstrip which caters for regular flights from Tingwall. The Papa Stour sword dance may be of Norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of England. A description of the dance appears in The Pirate by Sir Walter Scott. The writer and journalist John Sands lived on Papa Stour and Foula for a while during the late nineteenth century.

Meridian is rightly considered an architectural treasure trove being one the nations most intact cities from the turn of the last century. Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects. The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort-designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of post office built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills.

That same day, Clinton began landing 2,200 troops on Long Island. The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6 km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at the northern end of Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan. General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17. An attempt to wade the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder-deep, too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition. He considered using boats to ferry the troops across, but the Americans, with timely advice from General Lee, adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position. As a result, the British and American forces faced each other across the channel, engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range. Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have \"the glory of being defeated alone.\" The attack was originally planned for June 24, but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days. On the morning of June 28, Fort Sullivan was defended by Colonel Moultrie, commanding the 2nd South Carolina Regiment and a company of the 4th South Carolina Artillery, numbering 435 men.

In the meantime, the army had been increased by the 9th and 24th Regiments of Foot, and the Rangers.

By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols. When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy. The king was furious at the demand and kept the Mongol envoys waiting for weeks. The court finally devised a compromise: the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king. Accompanying them was a Burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the Burmese king's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing. The king then promptly ordered an expedition, which retook the rebellious borderland regions in April 1272. The rebel leader A-Pi (\u1021\u1015\u102d) was brought back to Pagan.

Though it was ultimately under Mongol command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were Turkic-speaking peoples or people from the further west: Turks from Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv and Nishapur, but also captive soldiers from the Khwarazmid empire, the Kipchaks, and even Bulgars from the lower Volga.

Against this, the Japanese had lost at least 169 killed. Following the advance to the Hongorai, there was a pause of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance. The main crossing was planned for 20 May, with the 58th/59th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the Buin Road and the Aitara Track to the east of the river, while on the left the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion would divert the attention of the Japanese off the 24th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line, crossing at the Pororei ford, advancing straight up the Buin Road. Preliminary moves began before this, and on 15 May a platoon from the 24th Infantry Battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on Egan's Ridge. After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a Japanese field gun, they were forced to withdraw. Meanwhile, the RNZAF Corsair squadrons\u2014now reinforced by No. 16 Squadron\u2014began an eight-day aerial campaign, attacking along the length of the Buin and Commando Roads.

{"prefix": "At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes.", "gold": "Fighting between Aborigines and Europeans was localised as the Aborigines did not form confederations capable of sustained resistance. As a result, there was not a single war, but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent. Organised or disorganised however, a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century. This warfare contradicts the popular and at times academic \"myth\" of peaceful settlement in Australia. Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence, resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres. Among the most famous is the Battle of Pinjarra in Western Australia in 1834. Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however, and after the Myall Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings. However, in Tasmania the so-called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832, and aimed at driving most of the island's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas. Although it began in failure for the British, it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population. It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Aborigines. Although many more Aborigines died than British, this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans. Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre-existing hunting and fighting practices\u2014using spears, clubs and other primitive weapons. Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main Aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans. Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them. On occasions large groups of Aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the Aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aborigines than the Europeans.

The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the UPDB. A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle Tours by seventy years, the route followed \"a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ...\" This route followed the modern US 2 from Ironwood to the M\u201194 junction in Manistique, using the modern M\u201169 and M\u201195 to stay in Michigan. Branches of the route followed US 41 and M\u201135 between Powers and Escanaba. The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan. The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well. In 1920, the King's International Highway linked Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the Trans-Canada Highway name. The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was M\u201112, a designation that was in use by July 1, 1919, between Ironwood and Sault Ste. Marie. The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US 2 near Iron River in 1919\u201320. When the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, US 2 partially replaced M-12. Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain, US 2 was routed through Florence, Wisconsin. The former routing of M\u201112 from Crystal Falls to Sagola became a new M\u201169 when the former M\u201169 became US 102 (now US 141).", "text1": " It is known locally as the \"Old 2\".", "text2": " Cloverland started on the south with Lakeshore Road in Ironwood, ran east on Cloverland Drive to the Highway 28-U.S. Highway 45 interchange northwest of Iron River and turned north on Highway 28, crossing Highway 45 to the former State Road 61, then the present U.S. Highway 41-Door Peninsula League of Towns Highway.

{"prefix": "Parker's fleet had an extremely difficult crossing. Battered by storms and high seas, the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at Cape Fear until April 18, and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3.", "gold": "After several weeks there, in which the British troops raided Patriot properties, Clinton, Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations. Parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions up and down the coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there. John Rutledge, recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina's revolutionary government, organized a defense force under the command of 46-year-old Colonel William Moultrie, a former militiaman and Indian fighter. These forces comprised three infantry regiments, two rifle regiments, and a small artillery regiment; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies, and the total force numbered about 2,000. These forces were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and Virginia (1,900 troops), as well as militia numbering 2,700 from Charleston and the surrounding backcountry. Moultrie saw Sullivan's Island, a sandy spit of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about long and a few hundred yards wide, as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from intruding enemy warships. A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar, a series of submerged shoals lying about southeast of the city, and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan's Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor. Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island, where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city. Moultrie and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan's Island in March 1776, and began construction of a fortress built out of palmetto logs to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor. The construction moved slowly; Captain Peter Horry of the Patriot naval detachment described the site as \"an immense pen 500 feet long, and 16 feet wide, filled with sand to stop the shot\". The gun platforms were made of planks two inches thick and fastened with wooden spikes. Congress had appointed General Lee to command the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies, and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton's fleet as it sailed south. Lee wrote from Wilmington on June 1 that the fleet had sailed, but that he did not know whether it was sailing for Virginia or South Carolina. He headed for Charleston, saying \"[I] confess I know not whether I shall go to or from the enemy.\"", "text1": " However, Cornwallis was able to recapture Cape Fear from a force of North Carolina militia and a unit of Georgians commanded by General Robert Howe, before the bulk of his force arrived.

This gave Cornwallis the numbers and resources to begin the siege of Charleston in early June.\nCape Fear like most places along the Carolina coast has never fully recovered from the Revolution. Since the war, the economic life of this section of the coast has consisted primarily of fishing, manufacturing, and processing.\nWhen you visit Cape Fear today, you will find an historic coastal area filled with rich colonial, Revolutionary, and Civil War heritage sites.

European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation.", "gold": "By and large neither the British nor the Aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare. At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes. Fighting between Aborigines and Europeans was localised as the Aborigines did not form confederations capable of sustained resistance. As a result, there was not a single war, but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent. Organised or disorganised however, a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century. This warfare contradicts the popular and at times academic \"myth\" of peaceful settlement in Australia. Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence, resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres. Among the most famous is the Battle of Pinjarra in Western Australia in 1834. Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however, and after the Myall Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings. However, in Tasmania the so-called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832, and aimed at driving most of the island's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas. Although it began in failure for the British, it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population. It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Aborigines. Although many more Aborigines died than British, this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans. Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre-existing hunting and fighting practices\u2014using spears, clubs and other primitive weapons. Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main Aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans.

Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24, 1910. It states: \"Life in a country town is often tedious and tiresome, and were it not for the little dinners and teas the townsfolk are constantly given, existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed. So the time honored get-togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay. The Gales thought well of this established feature. They made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests. They were hardly an overly wealthy family, and their table was never notable for an oversupply of the good things of life, but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time.\" \"On the night before such an event neither Mamma, Pappa, or Daughter Gale could get those minutes' solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests' comfort. At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape. So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors.", "text1": " The father has purchased two dozen pies for the dinner and accidentally mistakes a store of mince meat for a store of store of live mice.

Some fellow pupils became hostile, though he says they were just trying to \"have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter\" rather than acting out of jealousy.", "gold": "As his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors. He admitted he was not a very good student, considering school useless and finding the work \"really difficult\". He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. \"The paparazzi, they'd love it\", he told Details magazine in 2007. \"If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were.\" Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at age five, and, aged ten, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield (1999), portraying the title character as a young boy. Radcliffe made his film debut in The Tailor of Panama (2001), an American film based on John le Carr\u00e9's 1996 spy novel, and a moderate commercial success. In 2000, producer David Heyman asked Radcliffe to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling book by British author J. K. Rowling. Rowling had been searching for an unknown British actor to personify the character, and the film's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, \"This is what I want. This is Harry Potter\" after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield. Eight months later, following several auditions, Radcliffe was selected to play the part. Rowling endorsed the selection, saying: \"I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\" Radcliffe's parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two-film contract with shooting in the UK; Radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would act in more than two Harry Potter films.

Looking Cloud and Graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010, by federal and South Dakota state juries, respectively. By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted. Means attributed the split in AIM to divisions in the aftermath of Aquash's murder. The journalist Harlan McKosato said in 1999, \"...her [Aquash's] death has divided the American Indian Movement...\" The schism continued, with the national AIM leadership claiming that the local AIM leaders, such as Churchill, are tools of the U.S. government used against other American Indians. The leaders of the national AIM organization, now called AIM Grand Governing Council, claim that Churchill has worked in the past as an underground counter-intelligence source for the U.S. government, for example the FBI, and local, non-Indian, police forces, to subvert the national AIM organization. Specifically, they refer to a 1993 Boulder, Colorado interview with Jodi Rave, a former columnist for the Denver Post, in which Churchill stated that he \"was teaching the Rapid City Police Department about the American Indian Movement.\" In addition, Vernon Bellecourt accused Churchill of having 'fraudulently represented himself as an Indian' to bolster his credentials. Bellecourt said he complained to the University of Colorado about this as early as 1986.

{"prefix": "The Battle of the Hongorai River took place during the Second World War and involved Australian, New Zealand and Japanese forces. Part of the wider Bougainville Campaign of the Pacific theatre, the battle was fought in the southern sector of Bougainville Island.", "gold": "Coming after the Battle of Slater's Knoll in which a strong Japanese counterattack was defeated, the battle occurred in two distinct periods between 17 April and 22 May 1945, as elements of the Australian 15th Brigade advanced south along the Buin Road. The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the Hongorai River. Following the end of the early fighting, the Australian advance towards the main Japanese concentration at Buin continued as they struck out towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. This continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective, washing away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians relied for supplies. As the Australian advance stalled, the Japanese began harassing the Australian line of communications, and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late-July and into August, the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards Buin again. Ultimately, though, the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began, bringing the campaign to an end. Japanese forces had landed on Bougainville in early 1942, capturing it from the small force of Australians garrisoning the island. They had subsequently developed several airbases on the island, using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the United States, Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area. These bases also helped protect Rabaul, the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea, and throughout 1943, Allied planners determined that Bougainville was vital for neutralising the Japanese base around Rabaul. US Marines conducted an amphibious landing at Cape Torokina, on the western coast of the island, north of Empress Augusta Bay, in November 1943. After an initial counter-attack, the US Marines had been replaced by a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around Torokina, establishing a strong perimeter. In March 1944, the Japanese launched a heavy counter-attack, which was turned back with heavy casualties. After this, the situation on Bougainville became largely static, as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence, and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around Torokina.", "text1": " Japanese units attacked the beachhead at Buin and Cape Torokina, defended by Australian and New Zealand troops.

The conflict was over by 1864, and the Waikato Regiments disbanded in 1867. However, many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade, while many others had returned to Australia. From 1870 until 1901, each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the 1870s\u2014including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units\u2014they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense. By 1885, the forces numbered 21,000 men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century, with the colonies raising contingents to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China. Despite a reputation of colonial inferiority, many of the locally raised units were highly organised, disciplined, professional, and well trained. During this period, defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery, based on garrisoned coastal forts. However, by the 1890s, improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards\u2014who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces\u2014to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry. As a consequence he called for a restructure of defences, and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies. Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be federated and for professional units\u2014obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific\u2014to replace the volunteer forces.", "text1": " The soldiers would endure more casualties during these engagements than they did during the siege, which was primarily a static affair.

{"prefix": "In November 2008, the government abandoned its attempts to ban Scientology, after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity. The report by the BfV cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful.", "gold": "First, the BfV report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization; there were German churches and missions, a German board, German bylaws, and no evidence that the organization was \"totally remote-controlled\" from the United States. A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one. The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology's aggressive opposition to the constitution. Here, the report found that Scientology's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow Germany's free and democratic basic order. \"Neither its bylaws nor any other utterances\" supported the \"conclusion that the organization had criminal aims\". The BfV also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence, but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning. Commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt, Ehrhart K\u00f6rting, Berlin's interior minister, said, \"This organization pursues goals \u2013 through its writings, its concept and its disrespect for minorities \u2013 that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution. But they put very little of this into practice. The appraisal of the Government at the moment is that [Scientology] is a lousy organization, but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to.\" The Church of Scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision, describing it as the \"only one possible\". Monitoring of Scientology's activities by the German intelligence services continues. In February 2009, the Berlin Administrative Court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the Berlin Scientology headquarters, warning passers-by of the potential dangers Scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom, should be removed. The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg, which ruled that the poster violated Scientologists' basic religious rights. The United States media, while generally reporting negatively on Scientology in domestic news, has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards Scientology in relation to Germany. Richard Cohen for example, writing in The Washington Post, said in 1996: \"Scientology might be one weird religion, but the German reaction to it is weirder still \u2013 not to mention disturbing.\"", "text1": " The difficulties included the freedom of religion, protection of freedom of assembly and respect for freedom of the media, all protected under the German constitution.\nThis decision followed years of action by the German state against Scientology and its associates, culminating in the action of the 17th State Prosecutor\u2019s Office in 2007. This set up a test case under the Neutrality Act (NeutLab), a law that was designed to protect the autonomy of the judiciary from the influence of government and those with vested interests. This application was made by the public prosecutor because of alleged interference by Scientologists in the judicial process in Bavaria.\nIn May 2009, the decision in the Neutrality Act case was announced. The court found that Scientologists had not exercised improper influence on the judiciary. In its ruling, the court said, \u201cthat the Scientology organizations had not used improper pressure on the judiciary, and that freedom of expression had not been interfered with.\u201d\nIn a press release following the judgment, the German government recognized that some illegal actions had occurred, but said they did not occur with the consent or cooperation of Church officials, and they were not in the nature of an organised Scientology policy.\nThis case may be seen as an important milestone in the history of Scientology. It brought an end to the previous government\u2019s attempts to ban Scientology, although the Bavarian state of Scientology remained intact.", "text2": " The whole issue is highly controversial. The matter will be studied in the education programme at both 11.2 Constitutional Rights in Europe and 11.4 Constitutional Rights in Germany. Using cases from Germany and beyond, the workshop explores the questions: what is known about the origins, activities and mode of operation of the Scientology organisation, and what legal effects does this have?\nThis workshop is designed in two interlocking parts. First, the participants themselves gather further information about the organisation and its work. They then debate what the consequences of the latest government report are, and they consider how constitutional courts have treated the topic, and they are then able to decide whether to continue the discussion in the workshop, or discuss some of the other subject areas on offer in the education programme.", "text3": "There is a lot of controversy surrounding the entire issue.

{"prefix": "A mass of and an inclination of 24\u00b0 were later found using high-resolution spectroscopy. Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface.", "gold": "The Spitzer Space Telescope measured the planet temperature, and found that the difference between the two sides of Upsilon Andromedae b of about 1,400 degrees Celsius, ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1,400 to 1,650 degrees Celsius. The temperature difference has led to speculation that Upsilon Andromedae b is tidal locked with the same side always facing Upsilon Andromedae A. Sudarsky had, on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium, predicted Upsilon Andromedae b to have reflective clouds of silicates and iron in its upper atmosphere. The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun's radiation; between that and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. The outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides, but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The chemical elements in the atmosphere can be studied by finding their absorption lines in the thermal spectrum of the planet; given typical planet temperatures, the spectrum has its peak at infrared wavelengths. So far, only water vapor has been detected in this planet, while carbon monoxide and methane are still under the detection limit. The planet is unlikely to have large moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system. The planet (with 51 Pegasi b) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by Planetpol. Preliminary results from polarimetric studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color, is 1.36 times as large and 0.74 times as massive as Jupiter, meaning that the mean density is 0.36g/cm3. It has a geometric albedo of 0.35 in visible light. Tidal heating models predict a similar mass for the planet. Upsilon Andromedae b appears to be responsible for increased chromospheric activity on its parent star. Observations suggest that there is a \"hot spot\" on the star around 169\u00b0 away from the sub-planetary point. This may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star. The mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of RS Canum Venaticorum variable stars, or the interaction between Jupiter and its moon Io.", "text1": " In the extrasolar planet Upsilon Andromedae C, researches believe they have found a planet with strong atmospheric methane. The host star is slightly smaller and cooler than our Sun with an effective temperature of 6, K and mass of 1. The planet has a low eccentricity, and is quite close to the star at only 0. So, the star appears 0.\nIt is now 20 light-years from Earth, and because its line-of-sight to Earth changes on a regular basis, it serves as a highly visible test for how our universe may have expanded in the last 15 billion years. It is a type F star with a mass of 1. The planet was discovered around the year, during a Doppler spectroscopy measurement. The planet was discovered in by Geoff Marcy and R. This gas giant has a mass about half that of Jupiter's mass. They are respectively 0. This is a list of potentially habitable exoplanets. It is therefore orbiting very close to the star, with an orbital radius of about 0. I apologize for my horrible math skills.

Upsilon Andromedae C Planet of five.", "text2": " The planet's host star is a star in the system of Upsilon Andromedae with a mass of at least 0.91 Earth masses (8,500 Earth M\u2013year), and a mean orbital period of Upsilon Andromedeae b of at least 11.21 Earth days (263.02 Earth d) with a distant orbit. [65][68] While a hot Jupiter planet that close to the host star would become uninhabitable to life as we understand it, the earthlike planets in the habitable zone at greater distance from their parent star would still be in the habitable zone for a time. [52] Its orbital inclination of nearly edge-on allows this measurement to be much more accurate, making it the first planet discovered by this method. [6] Other than its size and mass, the other factors that characterize this planet indicate it could be Earth's closest analogue yet, with a mass of only around one Earth radius. [75], In 2004 the transit method also led scientists to find another planet in the Upsilon Andromedae system, named Upsilon Andromedae e. However, it lies close to the habitable zone, but is far enough from Upsilon Andromedae to possibly be uninhabitable due to the extreme cold of the location.", "text3": "The host star of the planet is located in the Upsilon Andromedae system, has a mass of at least 0.91 Earth masses, and orbits Upsilon Andromedae b with a mean orbital period of at least 11.21 Earth days in a distant orbit. Earthlike planets in the habitable zone further away from their host star would remain habitable for a longer period of time compared to a hot Jupiter planet located closer to the star. This planet was the first to be discovered using this method due to its nearly edge-on orbital inclination, which allowed for a more accurate measurement. This planet is similar to Earth in size and mass, making it a strong candidate for being Earth's closest match. In 2004, scientists used the transit method to discover another planet in the Upsilon Andromedae system, known as Upsilon Andromedae e.

{"prefix": "Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service, known as the New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804.", "gold": "Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion, a coup mounted by its officers in 1808. As a result, in January 1810 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By 1870, 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units. Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack, no actual threat ever materialised. The British Army was instead used in policing, guarding convicts at penal institutions, combating bushranging, putting down convict rebellions\u2014as occurred at Bathurst in 1830\u2014and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement. Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 on the Victorian goldfields. Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan. During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by units detached by the Royal Navy's Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, based in Sydney. However, in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a commodore, marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia. The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913, when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy; the Royal Navy's depots, dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people. The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied, but were inevitably hostile when the settlers' presence led to competition over resources, and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants' lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation. By and large neither the British nor the Aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare. At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes.", "text1": " In addition, the NSW Corps, aided by local Aborigines, fought the Bushranger movement in the 1820s. During the First World War, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade took part in fighting at Gallipoli, Turkey and later the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in Egypt.\nFrom 1941 to 1942, the 2/30th Battalion (New South Wales Citizens Military Force) was part of the Australian Imperial Forces sent to defend Darwin from a feared Japanese invasion. They were also involved in the unsuccessful defence of Rabaul. Over the next few years, they fought in many fierce battles against the Japanese in the Pacific, in countries such as New Guinea and Bougainville.\nThe Australian Army Air Corps formed in 1922 by the amalgamation of the Australian Flying Corps and the Australian Military Forces Air Units. In 1921, Australia sent a 'Miscellaneous Unit' to the Royal Air Force (RAF) for training in the RAF during the interwar period. The 31 Aircraft Maintenance Squadron is the most senior surviving unit of the Australian Flying Corps and Australian Army Air Corps.", "text2": " The New South Wales Corps was broken up and its officers sent to England in 1810, and with the subsequent arrival of the First (regular) British Infantry regiment in the same year the distinction between military and civil power was re-established, and a permanent garrison was established in the colony.\nIn 1821 New South Wales received another infantry garrison, the Second (Queen's Own Light) Foot. These troops maintained order in the colony for a number of years before being called upon to assist in the formation, command and training of the first permanent colonial troops. Troops for this purpose arrived on the convict transports Nile and Bussorah-Merchant in September and October 1826, including two 40-man units of mounted infantry (nicknamed'stockmen'). The original 40 mounted infantrymen were given semi-permanent rates and conditions.\nIn 1826, Major Dumaresq was given temporary command of the infantry companies and a sergeant was given overall command of the stockmen or mounted infantry. The infantry companies grew rapidly in number throughout 1826, and on the formation of the Volunteer Corps in December that year they amalgamated with the Volunteer infantry companies of the Light Infantry.\nIn 1826, Major Dumaresq was given temporary command of the infantry companies and a sergeant was given overall command of the stockmen or mounted infantry.", "text3": "In 1810, the New South Wales Corps was disbanded and its officers were sent to England, while a British Infantry regiment arrived to re-establish the separation between military and civil authority in the colony.

The song was written in B.", "gold": "It uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating, followed by the final two verses and a coda. Lead Belly first recorded \"The Bourgeois Blues\" in December 1938 in New York City, for donation to the Library of Congress. He re-recorded the song in April 1939 for Musicraft Records, for release the same year as a 78 rpm record. The version that was commercially released features Lead Belly singing and playing the twelve-string guitar without any other accompaniment. The song has been covered and reinterpreted by a variety of artists including Pete Seeger and Hans Theessink. Seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums. In Australia, the song was reworked as \"Canberra Blues\" by The Bitter Lemons, an R&B band. The lyrics speak of the problems faced by young Australians in the Australian Capital Territory in the 1960s. Theessink adapted the song to his style of European blues for the album Journey On in 1997. In 2006, Billy Bragg reworked the song as \"Bush War Blues\". Bragg's cover is a topical protest song about the Iraq War. In one verse, Bragg claims that the Iraq War was not for democracy but instead was to \"make the world safe for Halliburton\". In another, he takes on the Christian right, asking where the moderates are. Finally, Bragg chides the United States government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war. \"The Bourgeois Blues\" is one of Lead Belly's most famous songs and is remembered as his most \"heartfelt protest song\". There is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance. Robert Springer claims that the song is \"peripheral\" to the wider study of the blues, while Lawson points to it as a watershed in the way African Americans see themselves in the fabric of the United States. There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics. After its release, it became popular with left-wing political groups. Lead Belly was invited to perform at Camp Unity, the Communist Party USA's summer retreat, and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s. This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform. The party claims, to the contrary, that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform. Jeff Todd Titon and several other writers have suggested that Lead Belly had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song.", "text1": " Also includes a detailed analysis of the arrangement. \u00a0 [ pdf ]\nThe bass line and left hand lead chart for this composition by Duke Ellington can be downloaded here.

{"prefix": "Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product. As noted above, variants that deviate from this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation.", "gold": "In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule must be in the s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with \u03b1-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating \u03b1-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation. Similarly, \u03b2-substitution directed inward restricts the s-trans conformation so severely that E-Z isomerization has been shown to occur in advance of cyclization on a wide range of substrates, yielding the trans cyclopentenone regardless of initial configuration. In this way, the Nazarov cyclization is a rare example of a stereoselective pericyclic reaction, whereas most electrocyclizations are stereospecific. The example below uses triethylsilyl hydride to trap the oxyallyl cation so that no elimination occurs. (See Interrupted cyclizations below) Along this same vein, allenyl vinyl ketones of the type studied extensively by Marcus Tius of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of \u03b2-hydrogens, obviating a large amount of steric strain in the s-cis conformer. Though cyclizations following the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov's involvement, it was his study of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process. Nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product. The reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone. Research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years, until in the mid-1980s when several syntheses employing the Nazarov cyclization were published. Shown below are key steps in the syntheses of Trichodiene and Nor-Sterepolide, the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual alkyne-allene isomerization that generates the divinyl ketone.", "text1": " Methyl iodide or hydrogen chloride may be added as a proton source.

The Sault\u2013Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of US 2 between Escanaba and St. Ignace. The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste. Marie. In the age of the auto trail, the roads that later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names. When the original roadways between Ironwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau (UPDB) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919.

The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF's ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF's ability to mount and sustain such operations. In response, the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Australian government committed to improve the ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF to 57,000 full-time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year. In May 2006, 2,000 ADF personnel were again deployed to East Timor as part of Operation Astute, following unrest between elements of the Timor Leste Defence Force.

The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by moving walls or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents. Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rapidly spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or by rolling on the ground. At the start of the game, the player is given three lives, each of which may be lost if Sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects while in possession of no rings, falls to the bottom of the level screen, or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit.

{"prefix": "From the mid-1990s onward, press articles, reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis, accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience. As noted by the religious scholar Hubert Seiwert, Scientology came to be seen as a \"serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will-less zombies, but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state\".", "gold": "This view of Scientology as a public enemy, Seiwert adds, \"became a matter of political correctness\": senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology, and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social ostracism. Stephen A. Kent, writing in 1998, noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed. Scientology was viewed as \"a totalitarian, business-driven organization [...] guilty of significant human rights abuses.\" Officials examining primary and secondary sources, legal documents, and the testimony of former members, concluded that the organization was \"antithetical to a democratic state\". Federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology. Government publications on the dangers of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, in large part because of public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services. An area of widespread concern in the German media has been the alleged \"infiltration\" of businesses by Scientologists, in line with Scientology's declared aim to penetrate society, politics and business in preparation for world domination. Attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium-size companies, such as estate agents, management consultants and management-training companies.", "text1": " To many Germans, Scientology seemed to be a frightening and exotic threat.\nA radical social and political shift had occurred in Germany. After the end of the Second World War, West German authorities embraced the notion that science could produce solutions to Germany's past and present problems. This mentality combined with the deeply held belief that secularisation was desirable and would produce positive effects on society.\nHence, for the majority of West Germans, state atheism was a way of dealing with the Nazi past. However, not all Germans saw the secularisation process as desirable. Instead, a deeply held belief in the Bible and religion manifested itself in small pockets. Therefore, from the early 1960s onward, a few journalists reported that Christian fundamentalism and neo-Nazism had returned to Germany. The journalists argued that fundamentalism threatened to undermine the progress achieved by the so-called \"Democratic Revolution\" in West Germany.\nThese journalists based their arguments on a legal anomaly: the constitution did not recognise any religious organisations, but instead dealt with religious organisations under criminal law. The German courts had identified a dangerous ideology in Protestant and Catholic fundamentalism and neo-Nazism, but not in Scientology.\nAs a result, journalists such as Gerhard Forster and John F. Burns, writing for the German and American media respectively, spoke out against this legal discrimination.", "text2": "1 Even the sociologists started to describe the Church of Scientology, or the Scientology empire, using terms that characterise criminal gangs.2 It hardly comes as any surprise that following in the footsteps of the sociologists, church and police officials speak in increasingly similar terms when describing Scientology and its present-day leader David Miscavage.\n\"It is difficult to prove the degree to which the danger they pose can actually be demonstrated.\"3\n\"In the present situation the whole issue is so clouded that it cannot really be said whether this organization is threatening the state constitution as such. The present inaction of the police authorities, with the backing of the Ministry of the Interior [_Bundesministerium des Innem_, abbreviated BMI], does not in the least help to bring the facts to light.... It must be admitted that the reason for this abstention must be that no factual basis has yet emerged from current police operations which would justify criminal investigations against the _Bundesliga Borscht Regime._\"\n\"I can only explain this situation by assuming a certain tacit understanding that exists among the leaders of state agencies in the federal system [_Bundeslander_] and is protected from criticism. They understand each other: the higher authorities have made no secret of their general suspicion of the Scientology organisation, but, at present they cannot get involved in the investigation of the organization's supporters as the investigating officers are bound by some official constraints and they cannot produce the necessary grounds for prosecution.", "text3": "Sociologists began to compare the Church of Scientology to criminal organizations. It is not surprising that church and police officials are now using similar language to describe Scientology and its current leader, David Miscavage, after sociologists made comparisons to criminal organizations. Proving the extent of the threat they present is a challenging task. It is unclear whether the organization is truly posing a threat to the state constitution in the current circumstances. The lack of action by the police, supported by the Ministry of the Interior, is hindering efforts to uncover the truth. The reason for the police's lack of action is likely due to the absence of evidence justifying criminal investigations against the _Bundesliga Borscht Regime._ The situation can only be understood by considering a silent agreement among state agency leaders in the federal system, which is shielded from criticism.

A version of Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by Ancient and released in late 1991 for Sega's 8-bit consoles, the Master System and Game Gear. Its plot and gameplay mechanics are similar to the 16-bit version, though some level themes and digital assets are different and Chaos Emeralds are scattered throughout levels rather than special stages.

This section includes a truck-restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and Riverview Cemetery. North of I-295, Route 29 turns into a scenic and mostly two-lane highway. North of the South Trenton Tunnel, it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway, a New Jersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway, that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and Hunterdon County. The obsolete Delaware & Raritan Canal usually stands between the river and the highway. Most sections of this portion of Route 29 are completely shaded due to the tree canopy. Route 29 also has a spur, Route 129, which connects Route 29 to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Trenton. Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown Trenton to Newark, following present-day Route 179 and US 202 between Lambertville and Somerville and US 22 between Somerville and Newark. The route between Lambertville and Frenchtown was originally Route 29A. In 1953, Route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of Route 29A to avoid the concurrencies with the U.S. Routes. Route 29 between South Warren Street in Trenton and I-95 (now I-295) in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four-lane highway, with a portion of freeway, in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1995, the southern freeway part of Route 29 between I-195/I-295 and Route 129 in Hamilton Township was completed. This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002. A realignment of Route 29 in Lambertville by the 2000s made the route concurrent with the entire length of Route 165. Route 29 begins at a modified cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 195 and Interstate 295 in Hamilton Township, and it serves as the western continuation of Interstate 195, heading to the northwest as a six-lane freeway. The route has an interchange with Route 129, a spur of Route 29 which connects to U.S. Route 1, with a northbound exit and southbound entrance.

The last remaining defensive location before the Hongorai was Egan's Ridge, where the Japanese were sheltering in tunnels. A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge. It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry. Within a short period of time the Buin Road was subsequently opened, providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign, being the advance to the Hari, Mobiai, and Mivo Rivers.

Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies, with the ironclad HMVS Cerberus in service from 1870, as well as the steam-sail warship on loan from the Royal Navy, three small gunboats and five torpedo-boats. New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo-boats and a corvette. The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885, while South Australia operated a single ship, HMCS Protector.

On the 29th ballot, taken near the end of February 1908, Bradley finally secured a majority, after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him. Beckham's ardent support of Prohibition likely cost him the election. That put him at odds with Henry Watterson, editor of the powerful Louisville Courier-Journal. As governor Beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machine in Louisville. When the Kentucky Court of Appeals invalidated the results of Louisville's municipal elections for interference by the city's \"whiskey ring\" in May 1907, Beckham appointed Robert Worth Bingham, a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist, as the interim mayor until elections could be held in November. Bingham eliminated grafting in the police department, closed gambling houses, and enforced blue laws that closed saloons on Sunday.

In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the US Bullion Depository. After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations. True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States.

{"prefix": "Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them.", "gold": "On occasions large groups of Aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the Aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aborigines than the Europeans. Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms. However, the advantages afforded by firearms have often been overstated. Prior to the late 19th century, firearms were often cumbersome muzzle-loading, smooth-bore, single shot muskets with flint-lock mechanisms. Such weapons produced a low rate of fire, while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within . These deficiencies may have initially given the Aborigines an advantage, allowing them to move in close and engage with spears or clubs. Yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage, with the six-shot Colt revolver, the Snider single shot breech-loading rifle and later the Martini-Henry rifle, as well as rapid-fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle, becoming available. These weapons, when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of Aborigines, often proved successful. The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast-moving, often hidden enemies. Tactics employed included night-time surprise attacks, and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks. The conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia. Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May 1788, it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s. As the frontier moved west so did the conflict, pushing into outback New South Wales in the 1840s. In Tasmania, fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s, while in Victoria and the southern parts of South Australia, the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s. The south-west of Western Australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850.", "text1": " There were more Aborigines in the Sydney area at the time of European settlement, but the Sydney region was an outlying area for Aborigines and they were regarded as less of a threat.

The Eora and the Cadigal were two Aborigine tribes that were involved in the conflict with the European settlers. The Eora tribe lived along the western coast of the Sydney area, whereas the Cadigal tribe resided on the eastern coast. Aborigines in the Sydney area were decimated by European diseases and invasion, but there are still Aborigines in the region today.\nAborigines in the Brisbane area were never able to organize large-scale military operations. The number of Aborigines in the Brisbane area was reduced to the point where they were outnumbered by the Europeans.\nHow Did The Aborigines React To European Settlement?\nThe Aborigines reacted to European settlement by attacking the colonists.", "text2": " The government started offering bounties on the scalps of the \u2018black people in 1830, and many were killed this way, and many of the others starved.

On the New South Wales mainland alone it\u2019s thought that approximately half of the estimated 400,000 to one million Aboriginal people living in the region at contact with Europeans died as a result of European disease and starvation, and many more were killed in conflict, or through the implementation of European policies of containment. The prison system was often another place for Aboriginal people, who didn\u2019t know how to interact with the police officers (such as the New South Wales Police in Redfern), who didn\u2019t know how to interact with the \u2018blackfella\u2019 (often referred to as such by police officers).

The fort served as a \"general hospital\" (large military hospital) and prison until after the war. Following the end of the war, in October 1865 the US Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled. On January 14, 1870, the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas. The Post was based at Fort Scott, but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks, and seldom used the original fort. They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers. Some of the latter feared that the railroad, which had been awarded land for development by the US Government in rights-of-way, would evict them from their squatter homes. The settlers considered the troops lackeys to the railroads, and lumped both as enemies. Settlers also had some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurgents using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery. By the spring of 1873, the US Army withdrew the troops from Fort Scott for good. From 1873 to 1965, the buildings of the fort were left unattended, and slowly deteriorated. Many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use.

In this role Headlam occupied a seat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. He was also one of two RAAF representatives to serve on a committee, chaired by businessman William John Allison, examining conditions of defence service; the committee's recommendations led to a doubling of flight pay, among other improvements. Headlam's other positions at the Department of Air included Air Commodore Plans from October 1957 to January 1959, and Director General Plans and Policy from January to August 1959.

The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment, however. She opened with Alexander's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin, then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson, and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin: I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise, Innocent Ing\u00e9nue Baby, and Swanee. Gershwin played the piano for these pieces. Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Virgil Thomson, and Paul Whiteman. Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music, the performance was overall a huge success, and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art. Gauthier continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences. On some occasions, such as her performances of Gershwin in New York in 1923 and 1925, as well as in London in 1925, this was quite successful.

Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made. The long stocks were made from Douglas fir. All timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned. It was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to 20% stronger than a similar stock of solid timber. The timber used was thick and nine laminations were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft. Careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber. Both stocks were made during the work-in, with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use.

The average annual rainfall at Tikal is . However, the arrival of rain was often unpredictable, and long period of drought could occur before the crops ripen, which severely threatened the inhabitants of the city. Population estimates for Tikal vary from 10,000 to as high as 90,000 inhabitants. The population of Tikal began a continuous curve of growth starting in the Preclassic Period (approximately 2000 BC \u2013 AD 200), with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830, followed by a sharp decline. For the area falling within the earthwork defenses of the hinterland, the peak population is estimated at 517 per square kilometer (1340 per square mile). In an area within a radius of the site core, peak population is estimated at 120,000; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer (689 per square mile). In a region within a radius of the site core and including some satellite sites, peak population is estimated at 425,000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer (515 per square mile). These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive swamplands that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture. However, some archaeologists, such as David Webster, believe these figures to be far too high. The dynastic line of Tikal, founded as early as the 1st century AD, spanned 800 years and included at least 33 rulers. There are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as 1000 BC, in the Middle Preclassic. A cache of Mamon ceramics dating from about 700-400 BC were found in a sealed chultun, a subterranean bottle-shaped chamber. Major construction at Tikal was already taking place in the Late Preclassic period, first appearing around 400\u2013300 BC, including the building of major pyramids and platforms, although the city was still dwarfed by sites further north such as El Mirador and Nakbe. At this time, Tikal participated in the widespread Chikanel culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time \u2013 a region that included the entire Yucatan Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize. Two temples dating to Late Chikanel times had masonry-walled superstructures that may have been corbel-vaulted, although this has not been proven.

{"prefix": "Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BCE, Tikal reached its apogee during the Classic Period, c. 200 to 900 CE. During this time, the city dominated much of the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily, while interacting with areas throughout Mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico.", "gold": "There is evidence that Tikal was conquered by Teotihuacan in the 4th century CE. Following the end of the Late Classic Period, no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned. These events were coupled with a gradual population decline, culminating with the site's abandonment by the end of the 10th century. Tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities, with a long dynastic ruler list, the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments, temples and palaces. The name Tikal may be derived from ti ak'al in the Yucatec Maya language; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning \"at the waterhole\". The name was apparently applied to one of the site's ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region. It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning \"the place of the voices\" in the Itza Maya language. Tikal, however, is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the 1840s. Hieroglyphic inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as Yax Mutal or Yax Mutul, meaning \"First Mutal\". Tikal may have come to have been called this because Dos Pilas also came to use the same emblem glyph; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name. The kingdom as a whole was simply called Mutul, which is the reading of the \"hair bundle\" emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo. Its precise meaning remains obscure. The closest large modern settlements are Flores and Santa Elena, approximately by road to the southwest. Tikal is approximately north of Guatemala City. It is south of the contemporary Maya city of Uaxactun and northwest of Yaxha. The city was located southeast of its great Classic Period rival, Calakmul, and northwest of Calakmul's ally Caracol, now in Belize.

The tallest structure is a tomb with the remains of Jasaw Chan K\u2019awiil, the twenty sixth ruler, and one third of the Great Plaza, enclosed by a double wall, is protected on three sides and was topped by a massive plaster and stucco monument of an enemy leader (Spence).\nFinally the city contained a number of smaller enclosed residences, probably with individual families.\nAlso by the Classic Period, we believe that the city and surrounding lands had to be defended. Tikal at times was in conflict, and possibly at other times alliances, with the city-state to the north, with a network or roads.

After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma.", "gold": "The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports (Prome, Dala and Bassein), the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome. Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of Pegu revolted that same year. The king managed to send two small expeditions to Pegu but they both failed. Now, the entire eastern half of Lower Burma (Pegu and Martaban) was in open revolt. Given his precarious position, Narathihapate decided to buy time, and sue for peace with the Mongols. In November/December 1285, the king ordered his generals Ananda Pyissi and Maha Bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations. The Mongol commanders at Hanlin, who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named Zhengmian (), agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission. They repeated their 1281 demand that the Burmese king send a formal delegation to the emperor. The two sides had reached a tentative agreement by 3 March 1286, which calls for a full submission of the Pagan Empire, and central Burma to be organized as the province of Mianzhong (). After a long deliberation, the king agreed to submit but wanted the Mongol troops to withdraw. In June 1286, he sent an embassy led by Shin Ditha Pamauk, a learned monk, to the emperor's court. In January 1287, the embassy arrived at Beijing, and was received by the Yuan emperor. The Burmese delegation formally acknowledged Mongol suzerainty of their kingdom, and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country. (Indeed, the tribute was no longer nominal.) In exchange, the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops. For the emperor, the Burma campaign was the only bright spot; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly. He did not want to invest more troops pacify the rest of the kingdom. He preferred a vassal ruler.", "text1": " Wadung himself then tried to besiege Tagaung, but it held on until 2 February.

After the victory, the Burmese launched a daring attack, and broke the siege. Wadung's forces retreated to Tagaung, with their tails between their legs.\nAfter two days of reinforcement and rest, the Mon once again advanced south, and captured the city of Bagan. The conquerors' supposed difficulty is partly reflected in the contemporary sources, who report that \"the inhabitants, while keeping their rulers, lost their lives. The king, fearing for his own life, burnt his own city\".\nThat was the end of the reign of warlord Kyawswa, who died of his wounds some time in late 1287, but his adopted successor Hkun Law succeeded him, and continued the war with the Mon. The Burmese won back the city of Bagan on 29 June 1288, and the besiegers once again withdrew. Their attempt to retake Tagaung was another total failure. Meanwhile, the southern kingdoms were losing their independence.

{"prefix": "The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics: The rostrum of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in H. gammarus. The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red-tipped, while those of H. gammarus are white or white-tipped.", "gold": "The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red, while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red. Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size. Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female, whose shell is therefore soft, and a hard-shelled male. The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months, depending on the temperature, attached to her pleopods. Females carrying eggs are said to be \"berried\" and can be found throughout the year. The eggs hatch at night, and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15\u201335 days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a benthic lifestyle. The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild, and are poorly known, although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows. It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20,000 survives to the benthic phase. When they reach a carapace length of , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives. Homarus gammarus is found across the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco, not including the Baltic Sea. It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea, only missing from the section east of Crete, and along only the north-west coast of the Black Sea. The northernmost populations are found in the Norwegian fjords Tysfjorden and Nordfolda, inside the Arctic Circle. The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations, one widespread population, and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes, possibly due to adaptation to the local environment. The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway, which have been referred to as the \"midnight-sun lobster\". The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean. The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands: samples from the Oosterschelde were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel.", "text1": " The eye stalks of H. americanus are about twice as long as the antennae, while those of H. gammarus are shorter.

The sanctuary consists of three main areas: the saltwater section, the freshwater and river section, and the tidal wetland section.\nDo crabs have to be covered on the grill?\nMany homeowners prefer grilling their crab over an elevated fire. The crabs tend to stay moist while being cooked this way and do not dry out on the grill. However, grilling over an elevated fire does not always work well for some crabs and they can end up drying out quickly on the grill. Instead, try cooking your crab at a lower temperature by keeping it warm or putting an aluminum tray under the crab and grilling over an elevated fire.\nIs anemone a crab predator or prey?", "text3": "The tubercles on the carapace of H. americannns are more prominently developed.

The sanctuary is divided into three main sections: saltwater, freshwater and river, and tidal wetland. Is it necessary to grill crabs with their shells on? A lot of people like to grill their crab over a high flame. Grilling crabs with their shells on helps them retain moisture and prevents them from drying out. Grilling certain crabs over high heat can lead to them drying out quickly instead of retaining moisture. Instead of grilling crabs over high heat, consider cooking them at a lower temperature by keeping them warm or using an aluminum tray under the crab while grilling over a raised fire.

However, with the security situation in South Vietnam continuing to deteriorate, the US increased its involvement to 200,000 combat troops by early 1965. Australia also committed ground forces, dispatching the 1 RAR to serve with the US 173rd Airborne Brigade in Bien Hoa province in June 1965 and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions, including Gang Toi, Operation Crimp and Suoi Bong Trang.

In 682, Jasaw Chan K'awiil I erected the first dated monument at Tikal in 120 years and claimed the title of kaloomte, so ending the hiatus. He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on Calakmul when, in 695, he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered. After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory. By the 7th century, there was no active Teotihuacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had been razed by 700. Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style. Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today. In 738, Quirigu\u00e1, a vassal of Cop\u00e1n, Tikal's key ally in the south, switched allegiance to Calakmul, defeated Cop\u00e1n and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Cop\u00e1n.

{"prefix": "Homarus gammarus, known as the European lobster or common lobster, is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea. It is closely related to the American lobster, H. americanus.", "gold": "It may grow to a length of and a mass of , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws. In life the lobsters are blue, only becoming \"lobster red\" on cooking. Mating occurs in the summer, producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae. Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food, and is widely caught using lobster pots, mostly around the British Isles. Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean, with a body length up to and weighing up to , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually long and weigh . Like other crustaceans, lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow, in a process called ecdysis (molting). This may occur several times a year for young lobsters, but decreases to once every 1\u20132 years for larger animals. The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large, asymmetrical pair of feet. The larger one is the \"crusher\", and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the \"cutter\", which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. Usually, the left claw is the crusher, and the right is the cutter. The exoskeleton is generally blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment. The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap.

It also occurs in small numbers in the northern Mediterranean Sea, in parts of the Black Sea and near Greenland.

Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions, and Rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces. Square-shaped Fort Sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall, with walls made from palmetto logs high and wide.

An assortment of 31 cannon, ranging from 9- and 12-pounders to a few British 18-pounders and French 26-pounders, dotted the front and rear walls. General Lee, when he had seen its unfinished state, had recommended abandoning the fort, calling it a \"slaughter pen\". President Rutledge refused, and specifically ordered Colonel Moultrie to \"obey [Lee] in everything, except in leaving Fort Sullivan\". Moultrie's delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on June 27 that he would replace Moultrie; the battle began the next day before he could do so. Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to Haddrell's Point. The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31, and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day. Moultrie noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island (now known as the Isle of Palms), just a few hundred yards from Sullivan's Island; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan's. By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would \"land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns\" and that they could \"keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper\".", "text1": " Beginning with his \"wet\" surrender at Fort Sumter in April, 1861, this Confederate commander was repeatedly placed in awkward positions as he struggled to keep Charleston and other Southern cities from falling into enemy hands.

Hirokazu Yasuhara came onto the team to supervise Naka and Ohshima and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping. The trio came up with the idea of him rolling into a ball. After the hedgehog character was chosen, many characters were redrawn, and the team agreed on the environments' visual complexity, with particular focus on the colors. After this, four people came onto the team to speed development up. Due to the popularity of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic to take over the American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, it was slowed down.

The eventual game, as opposed to the earlier Sonic the Hedgehog prototype, gave him the ability to bounce off of walls. This was possible because programming the character to run along a wall was difficult. The gameplay remained an 8-bit affair due to the limitations of the game engine.\nI wanted it to be a very fast-paced game, which meant that I needed something else in it besides 'run left, right, run'. That's why I decided to add wall jumps.\nOriginally, this only applied to one direction, and Sonic's position was randomized by the game engine. Over time, he was programmed to always land on the wall after bouncing off of it. In turn, this resulted in the addition of an extra movement, the \"wall hop\". Upon this discovery, the game's engine was programmed so that the character could automatically bounce off of walls, as well as run along them.", "text2": " The development team included Naka as the director and main programmer, Aoto-san as the programmer, Tatsunoko-sama as the character designer and programmer, and Ryu who was a background designer and 3-D artist.\n\nSonic changed in the process, evolving in design and moving to be in the player character role instead of an enemy character.

{"prefix": "Uaxactun, together with smaller towns in the region, were absorbed into Tikal's kingdom. Other sites, such as Bejucal and Motul de San Jos\u00e9 near Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north.", "gold": "By the middle of the 5th century Tikal had a core territory of at least in every direction. Around the 5th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of Tikal's hinterland, joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of swampland lying to the east and west of the city. Additional fortifications were probably also built to the south. These defenses protected Tikal's core population and agricultural resources, encircling an area of approximately . Recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose. In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as Cop\u00e1n, whose founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' was clearly connected with Tikal. Cop\u00e1n itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Cop\u00e1n dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal. K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' arrived in Cop\u00e1n in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal. An individual known as Ajaw K'uk' Mo' (lord K'uk' Mo') is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person. His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan. Hieroglyphic texts refer to him as \"Lord of the West\", much like Siyah K\u2019ak'. At the same time, in late 426, Cop\u00e1n founded the nearby site of Quirigu\u00e1, possibly sponsored by Tikal itself. The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region. The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries. A long-running rivalry between Tikal and Calakmul began in the 6th century, with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile alliances arrayed against each other in what has been likened to a long-running war between two Maya superpowers. The kings of these two capitals adopted the title kaloomte''', a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to \"high king\".", "text1": " Uaxactun was probably used as a residence for nobles when they came to the capital for festivals. Tikal's history was greatly affected by contacts with other parts of the Mesoamerican cultural area. It traded with the Gulf Coast Olmecs and had close ties with El Mirador and other lowland sites to the north. Trade routes existed with Teotihuac\u00e1n to the west and the Maya highlands of Guatemala. As with many other Maya centers, the site was abandoned for reasons unknown around 900 AD. Tikal never fully recovered from the decline, although it remained a ceremonial center after the abandonment of the city.\nTikal was not occupied after the 10th century AD for about 500 years. Its population was already substantially reduced by 900 AD when it was abandoned. The landscape of Tikal, which was once lush jungle, became overgrown with secondary forest. It would have been difficult to maintain the temples and other buildings that survived the abandonment of the city. The Maya area was later settled by the Itz\u00e1 Maya, who established their own kingdom in the vicinity of Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in 11th century AD. In 1541, Franciscan missionaries led by a Spaniard named Hernando de Chaves visited the area and left records of their visits. However, it was not until the late 19th century that the modern world rediscovered the site.", "text2": " Tikal eventually fell to neighboring Caracol. \"In 830 AD Tikal enters a period of decline that sees a sharp decrease not in the size and number of monuments but rather in the number of monuments to which there are hieroglyphic dates. Between 830 AD and 870 AD more monuments were built without hieroglyphs, and only four datable monuments survived this era.\"\nThese obsidian tools were most likely brought by long distance trades. \"In many other areas in the pre-Hispanic period obsidian originated in the Guatemalan region, mainly from Zacpet\u00edn. It can be said that the dominant type of obsidian which was carried through the Itz\u00e1es territory was Zacpet\u00edn and accordingly, the type of obsidian which is found in the Tikal area also.", "text3": "Tikal was eventually conquered by the nearby city of Caracol.

{"prefix": "In the 16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet. By the 18th century, two Scottish lairds, Thomas Gifford of Busta, and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick, owned the island.", "gold": "They maintained a prosperous Haaf (Old Norse: 'deep sea') fishing industry, undertaken in the summer months using six-oared boats known as sixareens. In addition to the leper colony on Brei Holm there may have been another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Hamna Voe. A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony. The island church, which overlooks Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore Wick, was founded in 1806. 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of Sneeans or Sn\u00f8yans on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of Tusselby. It is called the 'ald kirk' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as \"the site of a Romish chapel belonging to about the twelfth century\". There is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day's work on the building was destroyed during the night. Eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re-commenced there successfully. Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib, suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it. In the 19th century the Crabbaberry fishing station in West Voe was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more. However, fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the 1870s on. At this time another duel entered the history of Papa Stour. Edwin Lindsay, an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres, was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one. He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835. Lindsay's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe. There are good examples of horizontal water mills, also known as Norse or Clack Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill-stone was sited.", "text1": " Following the development of new herring fishing grounds to the north of the Shetland Islands in the 19th century, the town grew rapidly and developed into a major fishing port. Later in the 19th century the town became a centre of the herring industry. The Hall, still one of the principal buildings in the town today, was built in 1888 to service the fishing industry. The wealth of the Herring trade was spread across the town with Halls' Fish Merchants and stores on Biddick's Lane and Fountain Quay.\nFrom then on, herring fishing gradually declined, but by the 1970s oil was discovered and the town of Lerwick has continued to prosper, taking full advantage of the North Sea oil and gas. Today it has become the largest town in Shetland and is the island\u2019s administrative centre.\nThe Bell Rock is a legendary rock located about 13 miles off the coast of Angus, Scotland. It was made famous by the Bell Rock Lighthouse, the first major offshore lighthouse to be constructed, by Robert Stevenson between 1807 and 1811.\nThe rock is now the base for a modern lighthouse.

{"prefix": "Fueled by events such as the Waco Siege in 1993, the murders and suicides associated with the Order of the Solar Temple, and the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo incidents in Japan, German fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s, with Scientology attracting particular attention. Perceptions that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert Vaughn Young, an American ex-Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology, visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der Spiegel, a widely read weekly magazine, describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a gulag \u2013 the Rehabilitation Project Force \u2013 for members of Scientology's Sea Org found guilty of transgressions.", "gold": "From the mid-1990s onward, press articles, reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis, accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience. As noted by the religious scholar Hubert Seiwert, Scientology came to be seen as a \"serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will-less zombies, but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state\". This view of Scientology as a public enemy, Seiwert adds, \"became a matter of political correctness\": senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology, and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social ostracism. Stephen A. Kent, writing in 1998, noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed. Scientology was viewed as \"a totalitarian, business-driven organization [...] guilty of significant human rights abuses.\" Officials examining primary and secondary sources, legal documents, and the testimony of former members, concluded that the organization was \"antithetical to a democratic state\". Federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology. Government publications on the dangers of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, in large part because of public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services.", "text1": " At the same time, opponents and critical former members of the movement in Germany and abroad reported the legal persecution of critics of Scientology by its European Office of Special Affairs (OSA). German officials responded by declaring Scientology a \"commercial enterprise\" and took a range of legal measures against it.\nMuch of this intense attention was triggered by the book Anti-Kult, which was authored by Gerhard Maruhn, a German retired general who formerly headed the Berlin branch of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs. In Anti-Kult, Maruhn claimed that the German anti-cult movement were all linked in a vast conspiracy against new religious movements. The book was published in 1993 and, according to a critic of Scientology, it was funded by the OSA through a holding company owned by a German friend of Maruhn's. At one time, copies of Anti-Kult were available in German airports, and its contents and conclusions have been widely cited in the anti-cult movement since its publication.\nIn 1995, Scientology in Germany was raided, and several hundred of its members, including some prominent Scientologists, were indicted and sentenced to short prison terms for practicing medicine without a license.

A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.

The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols. When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy.

In the 13th century, the Pagan Empire, along with the Khmer Empire, was one of the two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia. For much of its history, Pagan's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent Dali Kingdom and its predecessor Nanzhao, both with Dali as their capital city. Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west and at other times with China's Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself. Between the newly conquered Mongol territory and Pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan as well as the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges. The Mongol Empire first arrived at the doorstep of the Pagan Empire in 1252 by invading the Dali Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China. The Mongol armies captured the capital, Dali, on 7 January 1253, and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by 1257. The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song. For the next dozen years, they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land, which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India.

An alternate term was Chinese Mongols, to distinguish the Han Chinese from the Mongol race. This is similar to the use of Chinese American, as opposed to American to distinguish American-born Chinese, of whom only a small number are ethnically Chinese. Other terms for the ethnic Han Chinese in Ming China included gwei-ssu or guai-xiu, both meaning barbarians.\nIn most western historical texts, this 14th century conflict is called the Mongol\u2013Ming Wars, however, the Burmese term Naryan refers to the Han Chinese, rather than the Mongols.", "text2": " The Burmese invasion, according to the Y\u00fcan Shih, consisted of one army crossing from Yunnan to Burma to the north, while the other army crossed from Mien-yang \u2013 a site in the present-day Vietnam.

He further advocated for insurance companies doing business in the state to be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky to bolstering the state's economy and to provide policyholders some protection against fraud. Beckham refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars.

The AFC was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front, where they performed well. Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action in France and Belgium, leaving Egypt in March 1916. I Anzac Corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of Armenti\u00e8res on 7 April 1916 and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front, earning a formidable reputation. Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme, within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed. The 5th Division, positioned on the left flank, was the first in action during the Battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916, suffering 5,533 casualties in a single day.

By the time most of them reached Oka's positions at Kokumbona five days later, only half still carried their weapons. The Kuma battalion's survivors, attempting to follow Kawaguchi's Center Body forces, became lost, wandered for three weeks in the jungle, and almost starved to death before finally reaching Kawaguchi's camp. In total, Kawaguchi's forces lost about 830 killed in the attack, including 350 in Tamura's battalion, 200 in Kokusho's battalion, 120 in Oka's force, 100 in the Kuma battalion, and 60 in Watanabe's battalion. An unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the Matanikau. On and around the ridge, the Marines counted 500 Japanese dead, including 200 on the slopes of Hill 123. The Marines suffered 80 killed between 12 and 14 September. On 17 September, Vandegrift sent two companies from the 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment (1/1) to pursue the retreating Japanese. The Marines were ambushed by two Japanese companies acting as rear-guards for the withdrawal, and one Marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the Marines retreated. The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by Vandegrift. By nightfall, the Japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon, killing 24 Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving. On 20 September, a patrol from Edson's Raiders encountered stragglers from Kawaguchi's retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed 19 of them. As the Japanese regrouped west of the Matanikau, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 14 September, Vandegrift moved another battalion, the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment (3/2), from Tulagi to Guadalcanal. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade (the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment augmented by additional support units) to Guadalcanal.

The British did not attempt to take the fort again. Within days of the battle, Charlestonians learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. The British troops were reembarked on their transports, and on July 21 the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in its campaign against New York City. To add insult to injury, one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by Patriot forces. The British did not return to Charleston until 1780, when General Clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army. Until the South again became a focus of the war in late 1778, its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort. Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle, each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition's failures. Although Clinton was not blamed by the government, popular opinion held him responsible, and Parker was lauded for his personal bravery. Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort Moultrie shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William Moultrie for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston. Extensively modified in the years after the battle, it was supplanted by Fort Sumter as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War. In 1876, to celebrate the centennial, companies from Savannah, Augusta, Macon, Columbia, New York and Boston were invited to Charleston. The site was turned over to the National Park Service in 1960, and is now part of Fort Sumter National Monument. A small monument to the Battle of Sullivan's Island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island, overlooking the inlet where General Clinton's soldiers had hoped to cross. The monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement. One iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by Colonel Moultrie. Commissioned by the colonial government, he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner, which was flown at the fort during the battle. Despite being shot down during the siege, it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense (and famously raised during victory). It came to be known as the Moultrie flag or Liberty Flag.", "text1": " Even so, the ship did not burn and could have been refloated, but she was later destroyed to prevent her from falling into American hands.

Against all odds, they managed to get back to the Mississippi with casualties of only two killed and 11 wounded. General Foote and his 100 strong crew of marines and sailors joined a gun battery stationed on Round Point, which oversaw the Tennessee and Kentucky Rivers. After refitting and watering, he sailed westward down the Mississippi River in search of the enemy, having no knowledge of the strength or location of any Federal forces in the area. However, President Polk rejected the offer of a truce.

During April, the 6th Division, other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece. At the end of this campaign, the 6th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete. The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May, which also ended in defeat for the Allies. Over 5,000 Australians were captured in these campaigns, and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat.

Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code.

It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty. Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier.

He said that he had received intelligence that the Hunyani was being used for military purposes.", "gold": "Nkomo said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party's policy to kill civilians, and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground; by contrast, he said that his men had helped them, and had left them alive. He also accused Air Rhodesia of surreptitiously hauling troops and war materiel for the government, an allegation that Captain Pat Travers, Air Rhodesia's general manager, called a \"downright, deliberate lie\". According to Eliakim Sibanda, a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of ZAPU, Nkomo was implying that responsibility for the massacre lay with security force pseudo-guerrillas, more specifically the Selous Scouts unit, which had often been accused of brutalising rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion. Sibanda asserts that the massacre \"cannot be put beyond\" the Scouts, and also supports Nkomo's claim that the Hunyani had been used militarily, suggesting that ZIPRA might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board. \"Rhodesian television, before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique, had shown Viscounts ferrying paratroopers for the job,\" he writes, \"... [and] ZIPRA intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed [at Victoria Falls]\". A report published in the American magazine Time a fortnight later described the incident as \"a genuine horror story, calculated to make the most alarming of Rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true.\" The white community in Rhodesia heard the news with fury, and many turned their minds to exacting retribution for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism. The prominent Indian-Rhodesian Gulab family was particularly affected by the incident, having lost eight members in the attack. Although Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash, doing so only after four days' investigation, the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours. Smith wrote in his memoirs that the \"degree of anger ... [was] difficult to control\".

In Rhodesia, she had been one of the smallest ships on the white-operated Rhodesia Railways' inland waterways system; her demise caused a considerable amount of embarrassment to the Rhodesian authorities. The Hunyani's unusual 50' steel hull shape was developed for servicing railway bridges on waterways, because the ship could be floated in the centre of the bridge, with just its bow and stern projecting, and then secured using lines, to replace sections of the bridge where necessary. This feature, designed as a convenience for the rail workers, now made it very difficult to sink her with gunfire, because shells striking her hull would bounce off and do little damage. Eventually, it was discovered that if the ship's cargo of sugar was heated up it would begin to expand, and the resulting pressure would force the hull upwards to an angle of 20 degrees, whereupon it would remain. At this angle, it was easier to hit the hull, which then began to disintegrate, so that the Hunyani was finally broken up by gunfire.", "text2": " The attack resulted in the death of two civilians, a man, Robert Mutasa, and a woman, Lucy Takawira; and four soldiers.\nIn 1978, the party became the ZANU\u2013PF (PF standing for Patriotic Front).\nZANU also received support from Frelimo in its guerrilla warfare against the Rhodesians.

Following a series of minor victories, the British suffered a major setback during Black Week between 10\u201317 December 1899, although no Australian units were involved. The first contingents of infantry from Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania arrived in Cape Town on 26 November and were designated the Australian Regiment under the command of Colonel John Charles Hoad. With a need for increased mobility, they were soon converted into mounted infantry. Further units from Queensland and New South Wales arrived in December and were soon committed to the front. The first casualties occurred soon after at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900, after 250 Queensland Mounted Infantry and a column of Canadians, British and artillery attacked a Boer laager at Belmont. Troopers David McLeod and Victor Jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the Boer forward sentries. Regardless, the Boers were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting, more than 50 were killed and another 40 taken prisoner. Five hundred Queenslanders and the New South Wales Lancers subsequently took part in the Siege of Kimberley in February 1900. Despite serious set-backs at Colenso, Stormberg, Magersfontein, and Spion Kop in January\u2014and with Ladysmith still under siege\u2014the British mounted a five division counter-invasion of the Orange Free State in February. The attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General John French with the New South Wales Lancers, Queensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army Medical Corps attached. First, Kimberley was relieved following the battles of Modder River and Magersfontein, and the retreating Boers defeated at Paardeberg, with the New South Wales Mounted Rifles locating the Boer general, Piet Cronj\u00e9. The British entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900, while Ladysmith was relieved. Disease began to take its toll and scores of men died.

The Queenslanders were sent to reinforce the relief force that was marching on the Boers at Colesberg, while the South Australians accompanied the Canadians to relieve Mafeking.\nThe press of the time reported widely and often dramatically on the work of the Australian troops. However, what they did not report, and what was unknown to the Australian public, was that the Australians were not the first troops from Australia to reach South Africa. A group of 75 Broken Hill miners, hearing that reinforcements were being called for, left Australia on their own initiative. Under the leadership of Charles King, they joined the British Army at Cape Town as they marched inland, and as such, were officially the first Australians to serve overseas in a foreign war. They served throughout the siege of Mafeking, until they were ordered home, in May 1900. Today, the anniversary of the raising of the flag at Mafeking is commemorated in South Africa, with the King family in Broken Hill commemorating it in Australia.\nLater, in 1899, news reached the outside world of an international tennis tournament, played with the Queen's Cup in Pretoria between Boer and British teams.", "text2": " The first to see action were the New South Wales Mounted Rifles, who saw active service in the Orange Free State.

An underground cable was laid with assistance from British Telecom who were trialling a thrust borer which had been developed at their research facility at Martlesham Heath. The thrust borer laid of ducting through which the mains cable was pulled into position. The mill was then supplied with lights and sockets on each floor. Other work undertaken by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork, digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position. A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp. A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A Ruston & Hornsby 4YHR diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane. After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary. Off-site, the new brake wheel and fantail were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast-iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly. The fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir.

In 1990, Sega ordered its in-house development studio to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company. Sega president Hayao Nakayama wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse. Sega had competition with Nintendo, who was dominant at the time (particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario Bros. 3 featuring their mascot Mario), and Sega wanted a foothold in the industry. Although the company had some limited success with Genesis ports of its arcade games, it knew this would not be enough. The team developed ideas for characters, an engine, and gameplay mechanics. Originally, Sega used Alex Kidd as their mascot, but he was considered too similar to Mario and deemed unsatisfactory. Development emphasized speed, so Sega eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals, as well as fast creatures like kangaroos and squirrels. One idea, a rabbit able to grasp objects with prehensile ears, showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware.

There is a circle of stones near the beach at Housa Voe, which are the remains of a 'ting', or local assembly.", "gold": "This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson, who was accused of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called \u2018dominus de Papay\u2019. (The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above.) The remains of Duke Hakon's thirteenth-century house are still visible near Housa Voe. In 1469 Shetland came under nominal Scottish control, although the Norse 'Lairds of Norway' kept their Papa Stour estates until the 17th century. In the 16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet. By the 18th century, two Scottish lairds, Thomas Gifford of Busta, and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick, owned the island. They maintained a prosperous Haaf (Old Norse: 'deep sea') fishing industry, undertaken in the summer months using six-oared boats known as sixareens. In addition to the leper colony on Brei Holm there may have been another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Hamna Voe. A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony. The island church, which overlooks Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore Wick, was founded in 1806. 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of Sneeans or Sn\u00f8yans on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of Tusselby. It is called the 'ald kirk' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as \"the site of a Romish chapel belonging to about the twelfth century\". There is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day's work on the building was destroyed during the night. Eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re-commenced there successfully. Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib, suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it. In the 19th century the Crabbaberry fishing station in West Voe was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more.", "text1": " A Viking age burial site and a Viking village have been found in the area. Over the centuries, the influence of the Vikings was widespread. The Medieval Times Surnames generator creates 15 family names immediately, one at a time.

The result is a wide variety of Scandinavian country names such as Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and the Faroe Islands. Their descendants, known as the English, went on to develop their own language and culture. This is another name for the mythical Norse afterlife. Vikings in Norway remained relatively loyal to their king and were fierce fighters against the new kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden. Examples are Konungsstev, Eysteinnar stef, and Trondheimar stef.

In 2009, the video was included on Madonna's compilation, Celebration: The Video Collection. \"Sorry\" was performed on the 2006 Confessions Tour as part of the bedouin themed segment. Madonna was dressed in a Jean-Paul Gaultier kaftan with pants and high heeled boots.

It was a year in which other FBI informants had been discovered in AIM.

Looking Cloud and Graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010, by federal and South Dakota state juries, respectively. By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted.

During a concert on May 24, 2010, in the Prague club, Abaton, Blythe was involved in an incident that resulted in the death of Daniel Nosek, a 19-year-old attending fan. According to eyewitness statements cited by the Czech online daily newspaper aktu\u00e1ln\u011b.cz following Blythe's arrest, Blythe was chanting \"Come on!\"", "text1": " Nosek's family filed charges against Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe, who was put on trial in May 2012, found not guilty, and released on August 2, 2012. The NME has since reported that the Czech judicial system is revoking the not guilty verdict. Blythe is expected to appear in court again on February 4, 2013.\nRandy Blythe performed in a band called Agnostic Front (replacing Roger Miret as frontman) on September 15, 2012 in New York.\nThis page contains text from Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia - https://wn.com/Randy_Blythe_manslaughter_case\nFronting is the technique of \"playing through\" an event or series of events, concealing them from the object or person being targeted. The techniques are commonly used to prevent confusion or discord and avoid conflict.\nThere are three primary techniques used in a professional context to front an event, which include: facilitative, contentious and dual.\nFacilitative fronting refers to a situation in which one person (front person) provides \"feedback\" to another person (target) through a \"front agent\". Fronting may be viewed as taking initiative, offering feedback that will \"decrease distress, discomfort, [or] confusion\" for the target. Facilitative fronting occurs when the target person is unable or unwilling to offer the needed feedback.", "text2": " Ultimately a manslaughter charge against frontman Randy Blythe of Lamb of God was dropped, and United States ambassador Norman Eisen pledged increased cooperation on such matters.\nSoon prior to the concert, Blythe had refused to go onstage and perform as per a verbal contract between the band and promoter, but he subsequently played as agreed and a Czech metal concert festival made public his refusal.\nBetween 10 May and 19 June, Blythe had four encounters with the investigating officers of the Criminal Police of the South Western Czech Police Region, but he declined providing them with a written statement, and instead allowed them to visit Lamb of God in the United States in September. The head of the investigating party, officer David Mendlovec, and a Czech Embassy official discussed Blythe's status with the FBI in Washington on September 10, but, according to Lamb of God's attorneys, the FBI declined cooperation because of insufficient evidence that Blythe had intentionally inflicted the injuries on Nosek. The final hearing on the Blythe indictment date is set for May 28, at which point it can either be sent to the Court of the First Instance in the South Western Czech Police Region for a ruling of guilt, or dropped, if the lack of evidence cannot provide a conviction.\nIn June, a joint statement by Blythe's lawyer representing in the U.S. Marshall Porter and Hendler, P.A.", "text3": "In the end, the manslaughter charge against Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe was dismissed, and US ambassador Norman Eisen promised more collaboration on similar issues.

A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp.", "gold": "A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A Ruston & Hornsby 4YHR diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane. After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary. Off-site, the new brake wheel and fantail were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast-iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly. The fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft. The stocks and sails were made during the two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds.

It remains Starr's highest-charting single in the United Kingdom. The title for the song was inspired by English singer-songwriter Marc Bolan. Several commentators have interpreted the lyrics as an attack on Paul McCartney, reflecting Starr's disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years. \"Back Off Boogaloo\" demonstrates the influence of glam rock on Starr, who directed the documentary film Born to Boogie about Bolan's band T. Rex around this time. Described by one biographer as a \"high-energy in-your-face rocker\", the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus Voormann. Starr made a promotional film for the single in which he is followed around the grounds of John Lennon's Tittenhurst Park property by a Frankenstein-like monster. The single's B-side, \"Blindman\", was originally intended as the theme song to the 1971 film of the same name, a spaghetti western in which Starr had a starring role. Starr re-recorded \"Back Off Boogaloo\" for both his 1981 album Stop and Smell the Roses and his 2017 album Give More Love.

The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell. This perceived affront from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London, as well as from the team manager Scott, who felt that with the team's official apology after the England match, the controversy should have put to rest. The majority of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping to make more money that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with the fact that most of the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds. The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three of them, all against relatively weak opposition. The side's success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in Victorian Rules \u2013 the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in Victoria: against Melbourne, a Navy selection, and Victoria. The matches were all won, with their game against Victoria a 19\u20130 victory. After this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches, and defeated New South Wales 12\u20139.

{"prefix": "Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success; the original Genesis version bundled with the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive hardware had sold over 15 million copies by February 2009, and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by 2008. Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly gave the game an A+ and wrote that it was a very fast game, yet never felt chaotic or impossible, and they later named it the best game available in 1991.", "gold": "Primarily because of its Genesis bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog popularized the console in North America, thus making it a competitor to Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System. During October\u2013December 1991, the Genesis outsold the Super NES by two to one; at its January 1992 peak it had 65 percent of the market for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually overtook Sega, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo did not lead the console market. Sonic the Hedgehog inspired similar platformers starring animal mascots, including Bubsy, Aero the Acro-Bat, James Pond 3, Earthworm Jim, Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, and Radical Rex. \"Animal with attitude\" games carried over to the next generation of consoles, with the developers of Crash Bandicoot and Gex citing Sonic as a major inspiration. Sonic's success led to an extensive media franchise, with the first of many sequels, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, released the following year. It has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters, keeping Sonic and Robotnik (later renamed as Eggman) mainstays, and continued beyond Sega's exit from the console industry after the Dreamcast. The series has ventured from platformers to fighting, racing, role-playing, and sports games, and also expanded into anime, manga, cartoons comic books, novels, and toys. Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, with over 140 million copies sold or downloaded worldwide across consoles, PC's, mobile phones and tablets by May 2014. The game's first level, Green Hill Zone, has been seen in later other games, such as Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Generations, Sonic Mania, Sonic Forces, and the Super Smash Bros. series. The game inspired a number of unofficial variants, including Somari, a pirated Nintendo Entertainment System conversion featuring Nintendo's Mario character in levels from the original Sonic game, Sonic the Hedgehog Megamix, a total conversion mod of the original game, and Sonic 1 Boomed, a ROM hack which implements Sonic's redesign from the Sonic Boom animated series.", "text1": " Strauss also wrote that, the game had a stunning variety of levels, including places where all the ground was water, and if you were more than half submerged in water, you could glide through the air. Strauss wrote that the variety of the levels, Sonic's high speed, and an actual plot that revealed itself one secret at a time, made this game more than just fun. Other critics have echoed his views; RPGFan's \"The Genesis/SMS Tribute\" stated that Sonic The Hedgehog was the best game on Genesis and also that it was one of the best games of all time.\nParents need to know that \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" is a fun, engaging movie that does a good job of balancing action with humor, though it does still feature a few moments that may be too intense for some younger viewers. Characters drive super-speedy cars and motorcycles that can crash and explode, and the characters might be mistaken for supervillains because of the villains' \"Evil\" branding. But the movie also teaches some important life lessons about friendship and trusting yourself, as well as respecting your elders. Additionally, the Sonic character and certain actions he performs -- such as his famous \"spin-dash\" move and hiccups that propel him forward -- may be enticing to kids who want to imitate them. Most of the characters are good (except the villainous Eggman, of course), and some lessons are positive, including honesty and gratitude.", "text2": " On the other side of the Atlantic, a video review of the same year by Square 1 described the Genesis' improved visuals over those of the Master System and later added the Genesis' ability to support a lot of objects on screen (as compared to the Master Systems).

Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943. After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay. Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the Kokoda Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and USAAF. Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard-fought Battle of Buna-Gona. The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of Wau in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the Salamaua-Lae campaign in April. In late 1943, the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation Cartwheel, when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the Huon Peninsula during the Huon Peninsula campaign and Finisterre Range campaign. The Australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943. Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943. These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea, but were unsuccessful. On 14 May 1943 the hospital ship AHS Centaur was sunk by a Japanese submarine off Brisbane with the loss of 268 lives. Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI). Australia's role in the Pacific War declined from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there.", "text1": " Australia called up all of the reserves of the Australian Military Forces, giving the Australian Army an additional 50,000 personnel.

The Burmese king's troubles did not go unnoticed elsewhere in the kingdom. In the same year, a usurper named Wareru seized the southern port city of Martaban (Mottama) by killing its Pagan-appointed governor. Although the king's three sons were viceroys of the nearby Lower Burma cities (in Bassein (Pathein), Prome (Pyay), and Dala), the king, preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north, did not (or could not) take any action on Martaban. Throughout 1282, the Mongol command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of Champa and northern Burma. The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further; the emperor did not sanction an attack on Pagan itself. At least one army consisted of 14,000 men of the erstwhile Khwarezmid Empire under the command of Yalu Beg was sent to Yunnan to reinforce the Burma invasion force, which again was made up of Turks and other central Asians. On the Burmese side, the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals, he probably could not have raised a large one. By mid-1283, a Burmese army led by generals Ananda Pyissi and Yanda Pyissi was deployed at a fort at Ngasaunggyan. The invasion began on 22 September 1283. Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief of the invasion force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin. The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan. The Burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. (The chronicles say that the Burmese army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.) The Burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283. The defeat at Ngasaunggyan broke the back of Burmese defenses.

Warlike and militaristic by nature, they saw Burma as a backwater region and they made no effort to recruit and train its people for military service, concentrating instead on lucrative trade. Much to his displeasure, the Burmese king had to make overtures for peace and concede his tribute. They were forced to leave Pagan after they could no longer pay their taxes. The Paganese ruler, his hair now graying, knew what the Buddhist monk was up to and was understandably alarmed at the thought of the border villages under attack by another Buddhist order. Buddhist monks returned from their missions as far away as Cambodia and southern India and brought with them plants and animals from these lands, the precursor to an agricultural revolution. It was not a critical border battle for the Thai but nevertheless demonstrated the growing confidence of their military. Although the Burmese army had not fully recovered from its defeat and the growing number of border wars was causing more and more casualties, the Thai court still faced its enemies and the fate of its empire.

Australian forces began arriving on the island between November and December 1944, initially establishing themselves around the US base at Torokina. Due to inaccurate intelligence, Savige mistakenly believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17,500 men, and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere, rather than maintaining the defensive posture the US forces had adopted. However, Allied estimates of Japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of Japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40,000. The campaign that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east\u2013west avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further counter-attacks, while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast; and the main campaign in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around Buin. Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in December 1944, the Australian 7th Brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards Buin. In late March and early April 1945, they had fought the Battle of Slater's Knoll after which a brief lull followed as the Australians paused to shorten their supply lines. Meanwhile, the survivors of the Japanese force, heavily demoralised by their defeat, withdrew towards the Hongorai River. The Australian 3rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south, being tasked with capturing the Hari River, while the Hongorai was also included as an \"intermediate objective\". Japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the Australians at about 10,500 men, of which 2,300 were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd Division.

Parker's fleet had an extremely difficult crossing.", "gold": "Battered by storms and high seas, the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at Cape Fear until April 18, and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3. After several weeks there, in which the British troops raided Patriot properties, Clinton, Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations. Parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions up and down the coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there. John Rutledge, recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina's revolutionary government, organized a defense force under the command of 46-year-old Colonel William Moultrie, a former militiaman and Indian fighter. These forces comprised three infantry regiments, two rifle regiments, and a small artillery regiment; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies, and the total force numbered about 2,000. These forces were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and Virginia (1,900 troops), as well as militia numbering 2,700 from Charleston and the surrounding backcountry. Moultrie saw Sullivan's Island, a sandy spit of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about long and a few hundred yards wide, as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from intruding enemy warships. A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar, a series of submerged shoals lying about southeast of the city, and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan's Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor. Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island, where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city. Moultrie and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan's Island in March 1776, and began construction of a fortress built out of palmetto logs to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor. The construction moved slowly; Captain Peter Horry of the Patriot naval detachment described the site as \"an immense pen 500 feet long, and 16 feet wide, filled with sand to stop the shot\".

Parker sent a small ship and two boats under John Hazard to the New York City forts, but only three Americans came out of the fort. Then Parker sent a messenger to the largest fort on Long Island (not to be confused with Fort George) and the cannon from the two forts were brought into the fort. Then, on October 22, the British fleet came down on the fleet and chased the small fleet north. The crew of the eight-gun frigate Roma, fired their cannons on the British before being boarded by the British and being taken as a prize. The crew of the 22-gun frigate Orpheus did the same, but soon had to surrender. Parker ran the 16-gun Schoharie ashore and then sailed back south, where he was able to pick up a small frigate and the four small boats. Parker's fleet was now in rough shape.

{"prefix": "The development of an enantioselective Nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repertoire of Nazarov cyclization reactions. To that end, several variations have been developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts.", "gold": "Diastereoselective cyclizations are also known, in which extant stereocenters direct the cyclization. Almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of torquoselectivity; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to \"rotate\" in turn sets the stereochemistry as shown below. Silicon-directed Nazarov cyclizations can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way. In the example below, the silyl-group acts to direct the cyclization by preventing the distant alkene from rotating \"towards\" it via unfavorable steric interaction. In this way the silicon acts as a traceless auxiliary. (The starting material is not enantiopure but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the cyclization.) Tius's allenyl substrates can exhibit axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used. The example below generates a chiral diosphenpol in 64% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess. Tius has additionally developed a camphor-based auxiliary for achiral allenes that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of roseophilin. The key step employs an unusual mixture of hexafluoro-2-propanol and trifluoroethanol as solvent. The first chiral Lewis acid promoted asymmetric Nazarov cyclization was reported by Varinder Aggarwal and utilized copper (II) bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98% ee. The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50 mol% of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased. Extensions of the Nazarov cyclization are generally also subsumed under the same name. For example, an \u03b1-\u03b2, \u03b3-\u03b4 unsaturated ketone can undergo a similar cationic conrotatory cyclization that is typically referred to as an iso-Nazarov cyclization reaction.", "text1": " One approach employs a proline-catalyzed intramolecular ene reaction that provides access to functionalized bicyclic molecules in high enantiomeric excess. This reaction proceeds through a chair-like transition state. The enantiomeric excess of the product can be influenced by the nature of the substituent on the ring leading to the ene reaction as well as the substitution on the enone. Similarly, proline-catalyzed intramolecular hetero Diels-Alder reactions have been developed which utilize heterocycles as the diene. In contrast, catalytic enantioselective intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions have been limited to reactions of 3-methoxycarbonyl-1,4-enynes and 3-alkoxycarbonyl-1,4-enynes that proceed through a boat-like transition state. The diene for this reaction was generated in situ via a hydroxyl group elimination. Additional approaches to enantioselective Nazarov reactions include Lewis acid-catalyzed intramolecular reactions of enamines and imines. The chirality of the product in these reactions originates from the chiral auxiliaries utilized in the preparation of the starting material. An extension of this methodology to a Lewis acid-catalyzed intramolecular reaction of enamides has been investigated.", "text2": " However, none that are enantiospecific. While we have developed chiral auxiliaries, including one that permits enantiospecific syn addition of methanol to an endo dienol derived from an allyloxy aldehyde by a stepwise ring-closing strategy, the same strategy, even as modified, did not permit the use of chiral, non-racemic \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated keto aldehyde substrates.\nAldehyde substrates with aryl rings alpha to the carbonyl oxygen had proven unreactive in our previous reactions and therefore were studied in the context of enantiospecific ketonolysis of enol acetates. We were able to extend our range of substrates to that class of aldehyde substrates. Substrate structures include n- propen-1-ones with either an aromatic, heterocyclic or allyloxy group alpha (position two for a ketone) to the carbonyl oxygen. We were able to extend our previous findings to additional classes of substrates, and moreover, establish that the reactions are enantiospecific. The ability to enantiospecifically and enantiomerically produce the cyclopentanoids pentalenate, A, and versaticin A, B, from enantiomerically enantiopure aldehyde substrates was established.", "text3": "However, none of them are enantiospecific. Although we have created chiral auxiliaries for enantiospecific reactions, they did not work with certain substrates like chiral, non-racemic \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated keto aldehydes. We studied aldehyde substrates with aryl rings near the carbonyl oxygen in the context of enantiospecific ketonolysis of enol acetates due to their unreactivity in previous reactions.

{"prefix": "However, modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research. In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity.", "gold": "These have been successful to varying degrees. Additionally, modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction, either by generating the pentadienyl cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the oxyallyl cation \"intercepted\" in various ways. Furthermore, enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed. The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field; key examples are given below. The earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the Nazarov cyclization took advantage of the \u03b2-silicon effect in order to direct the regioselectivity of the elimination step. This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in the mid-1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron trichloride to promote the reaction. With bicyclic products, the cis isomer was selected for to varying degrees. The silicon-directed Nazarov cyclization reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product Silphinene, shown below. The cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety, so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether. Drawing on the substituent effects compiled over various trials of the reaction, Professor Alison Frontier of the University of Rochester developed a paradigm for \"polarized\" Nazarov cyclizations in which electron donating and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction. Creation of an effective vinyl nucleophile and vinyl electrophile in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper triflate and regioselective elimination. In addition, the electron withdrawing group increases the acidity of the \u03b1-proton, allowing selective formation of the trans-\u03b1-epimer via equilibration. It is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a donating or withdrawing group alone, although the efficiency of the reaction (yield, reaction time, etc.) is typically lower. By extension, any pentadienyl cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a Nazarov cyclization.", "text1": " Two common issues with eliminating a chlorine from vicinal diols are the incompatibility with common functional groups, such as esters, and the harsh reactivity of a promoter such as DBU. These two issues limit the use of this reaction in particular in drug discovery applications. A method for effecting the elimination under more mild conditions, but also maintaining regio- and stereocontrol, would greatly expand the scope of the reaction. Additionally, in the development of 1,2-chlorohydrin elimination reactions, the focus has been on increasing the nucleophilicity of the carbanion, i.e., making the carbon more basic, to increase the rate of the elimination. However, the opposite reaction, nucleophilic addition of carbanions to alkyl halides, is considered a difficult reaction, with one electron poor alkyl halides not being reactive enough, while those with a more electrophilic leaving group are not compatible with basic conditions. One of the aims of this project was to demonstrate that the reversal of this reaction, the addition of a carbanion to an alkyl halide, could be promoted with a less reactive alkyl halide and base conditions in an intramolecular fashion. Previous work has shown the addition of organometallic reagents to alkyl halides in an intramolecular fashion, but there is a lack of reports with carbanions.", "text2": " All three issues are manifested in the rate of the competing reaction of epoxidation to form 2.\nEpoxides are important intermediates for the manufacture of epoxy resin and epoxy additives. They may be used, for example, in the manufacture of epoxy compounds such as polyalkylene polyamines. For such applications, the use of less hazardous and more cost-efficient catalysts and reaction methods is desirable. Despite the attractiveness and versatility of the epoxidation reaction (for example cyclopentene, CH2CHCH2CCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2), the use of hydrogen peroxide as the source for active oxygen in the epoxidation reaction is problematic for a number of reasons related to the mechanisms of the epoxidation reaction.\nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for manufacturing a compound of the formula (I), which method includes reacting cyclopentene with a source of hydrogen peroxide as the source for active oxygen.

The field was located at the base of Long Street and had unstable stands. Despite the challenging playing conditions, the players' dedication to the team grew so strong that many continued playing even when their boots were falling apart and causing injuries. As the seasons changed from winter to spring, the field became firm and players were at a higher risk of injuring each other due to the grass roots penetrating the turf. Residents found the Union's actions in the working man's backyard to be comical and chose to oppose them. The players gained legendary status by consistently winning cups against local teams.

The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31, and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day. Moultrie noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island (now known as the Isle of Palms), just a few hundred yards from Sullivan's Island; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan's. By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would \"land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns\" and that they could \"keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper\". The British fleet was composed of nine man-of-war ships: the flagship 50-gun Bristol, as well as the 50-gun Experiment and frigates Actaeon, Active, Solebay, , Sphinx, and the bomb vessel Thunder, in total mounting nearly 300 cannon. The army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th, 28th, 33rd, 37th, 54th, and 57th Regiments of Foot, and part of the 46th. On June 7, Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms. However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it (which was flying a truce flag), and it was not delivered until the next day. That same day, Clinton began landing 2,200 troops on Long Island. The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston.", "text1": " Though the Americans were outnumbered, Moultrie's artillery shelled the British from an advantageous position. After several hours of shelling, the British made three attempts to storm the fort. All were driven off with heavy casualties. The fort suffered little damage and no casualties.\nThe news of the victory inspired great excitement in Charleston and throughout South Carolina. Along with the July 1775 victory over the British fleet in Machias Bay, Massachusetts, the battle of Sullivan's Island has been called \"the first victory of the American Navy.\" It was also the only time in the Revolutionary War that an American coastal fort successfully held off a British invasion attempt. As a consequence, the British never again attempted an amphibious landing against South Carolina during the war.\nThe British eventually recaptured the fort, and renamed it Fort Charleston, renaming Sullivan's Island Fort Sullivan. The British later evacuated the fort and destroyed it. Moultrie rebuilt Fort Sullivan and made it stronger than before.

{"prefix": "The planet takes 4.617 days to complete an orbit, with a semimajor axis of 0.0595 AU. A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found.", "gold": "The true mass may be much greater depending on the inclination of the orbit. A mass of and an inclination of 24\u00b0 were later found using high-resolution spectroscopy. Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface. The Spitzer Space Telescope measured the planet temperature, and found that the difference between the two sides of Upsilon Andromedae b of about 1,400 degrees Celsius, ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1,400 to 1,650 degrees Celsius. The temperature difference has led to speculation that Upsilon Andromedae b is tidal locked with the same side always facing Upsilon Andromedae A. Sudarsky had, on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium, predicted Upsilon Andromedae b to have reflective clouds of silicates and iron in its upper atmosphere. The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun's radiation; between that and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. The outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides, but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The chemical elements in the atmosphere can be studied by finding their absorption lines in the thermal spectrum of the planet; given typical planet temperatures, the spectrum has its peak at infrared wavelengths. So far, only water vapor has been detected in this planet, while carbon monoxide and methane are still under the detection limit. The planet is unlikely to have large moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system. The planet (with 51 Pegasi b) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by Planetpol. Preliminary results from polarimetric studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color, is 1.36 times as large and 0.74 times as massive as Jupiter, meaning that the mean density is 0.36g/cm3. It has a geometric albedo of 0.35 in visible light. Tidal heating models predict a similar mass for the planet.

From that, we have found that the true mass of Upsilon Andromedae b is 1.97 \u00b1 0.04 times the mass of Jupiter. It has been discovered to orbit its star on an eccentric orbit. It is the closest planet in the Upsilon Andromedae system and was the first planet outside of our solar system to be found orbiting a main sequence star. Due to the closeness of the star and planet, the planet is tidally locked to its star, meaning that it always keeps the same face to its star.

{"prefix": "Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west and at other times with China's Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself.", "gold": "Between the newly conquered Mongol territory and Pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan as well as the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges. The Mongol Empire first arrived at the doorstep of the Pagan Empire in 1252 by invading the Dali Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China. The Mongol armies captured the capital, Dali, on 7 January 1253, and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by 1257. The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song. For the next dozen years, they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land, which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India. The Mongols set up military garrisons, manned mostly by Turkic-speaking Muslims from Central Asia, in 37 circuits of the former Dali Kingdom. By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward appearances of calmness, had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258\u201360 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy. The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions.", "text1": " In 937, one of Nanzhao's generals, Gao Xingpio (also known as Law Kan), forced the Nanzhao emperor into exile and proclaimed himself king of Dali, thereby establishing the Kingdom of Dali.\nHis successors ruled the kingdom for almost 400 years, when the kingdom was annexed by the Yuan dynasty in 1253. After Mongol control ended, the area became a part of the kingdom of Kyaing Gyi Yoe. From the 18th century on, Dali became the seat of the Black Banner, Qing Dynasty military and administrative command in southwest China, which administered all ethnic groups of the southwestern plateau. The control of these communities was necessary in order to stop all local rebellions. It was during this time that the Manchurian presence in Dali was used by the 13th Dalai Lama to validate his control over the Tibetan areas west of Qinghai, at that time under the control of the Kokonor Mongols, who had converted to Islam.\nDali is the capital of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in northwestern Yunnan province, People's Republic of China.

Six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross. The Boxer Rebellion in China began in 1900, and a number of western nations\u2014including many European powers, the United States, and Japan\u2014soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests. In June, the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China. The colonies also offered to assist further, but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa, they had to rely on naval forces for manpower. The force dispatched was a modest one, with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria, 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector, under the command of Captain William Creswell. Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade reservists, who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role. Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks, Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War. The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors, while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks. The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the NSW Marine Light Infantry. The contingents from New South Wales and Victoria sailed for China on 8 August 1900. Arriving in Tientsin, the Australians provided 300 men to an 8,000-strong multinational force tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at Pei Tang, which dominated a key railway.

By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would \"land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns\" and that they could \"keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper\". The British fleet was composed of nine man-of-war ships: the flagship 50-gun Bristol, as well as the 50-gun Experiment and frigates Actaeon, Active, Solebay, , Sphinx, and the bomb vessel Thunder, in total mounting nearly 300 cannon. The army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th, 28th, 33rd, 37th, 54th, and 57th Regiments of Foot, and part of the 46th. On June 7, Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms. However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it (which was flying a truce flag), and it was not delivered until the next day. That same day, Clinton began landing 2,200 troops on Long Island. The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6 km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role.", "text1": " He surrendered the fort to the British forces of Lord Cornwallis on 14 May.

That movie - Sidney Lumet's Q & A - is the kind of picture that dissolves in the sun. An encounter like that might not actually land so much as one f-k in the way that a baton is passed by generations of goofy jocks, from Rodney Dangerfield to Tom Arnold to Jim Carrey to their grandsons.

He is a champion of the 103rd Grey Cup. Prior to being drafted by the Edmonton Eskimos in the fourth round of the 2007 CFL Draft, McCarty played high school football for the St. Thomas More Knights, where he broke multiple school records. He later played college football for the Western Washington Vikings. With the Vikings, McCarty developed into a dual threat, being used heavily as a rusher and receiver. McCarty has spent his entire professional career with the Edmonton Eskimos, making him the most veteran player on the team as of the 2015 season. McCarty played high school football for the St. Thomas More Knights in Burnaby, British Columbia beginning in 1998, playing as both a running back and middle linebacker on the Grade 8 team. He quickly became a key player on the team, including rushing for 185 yards and four touchdowns while adding 10 defensive tackles in the Grade 8 provincial semi-finals on November 24 against the Handsworth Royals. For that performance, he was named \"Star of the Week\" by The Vancouver Sun. The Knights went on to defeat the Vancouver College Fighting Irish 48\u20130 in the Grade 8 B.C. championship game, where McCarty scored another three touchdowns. The following year, McCarty joined the senior team at St. Thomas More, skipping the junior team entirely. He continued in his role as a running back while switching to the secondary defensively. Despite being a rare Grade 9 player on the senior team, he was one of the Knights' two leading rushers that year. McCarty scored a touchdown in the AAA B.C. championship game, helping the Knights win their first senior title as they beat the Pinetree T-Wolves 29\u20136. While K.C. Steele, the Knights' coach, has a policy of not recording player statistics, it is estimated that McCarty finished 1999 with over 1,000 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns.

Officers had brought their personal slaves with them, including Captain Swords.", "gold": "The border with Missouri was east of Fort Scott. In Missouri was a grog shop that supplied soldiers, and quite a few courts-martial followed soldiers' going AWOL at the shop. The desertion rate from the fort ranged from 12\u201316%, due to boredom, irregular pay, and hatred for military life. As no combat took place near the fort, it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base. Hunting was a popular pastime; according to Captain Swords, \"wolf chasing and duck hunting\" was the only way one officer could tolerate the place. Two years after the army abandoned the fort, the buildings were sold by auction to civilians, with two being converted to hotels. In 1854 the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had kept slavery out of Kansas. Missourians in favor of slavery soon moved to Kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not Kansas would permit slavery. Settlers from New England arrived equally determined to keep it out. Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort Scott: Free-Soil at the Fort Scott Hotel and Pro-Slavery at the Western Hotel. Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery, but those outside the town tended to the free-soil side. During this time, there were local incidents of murder and attempted arson, typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting. During the American Civil War, the fort was renewed as a US military post. In August 1861, the Union Army took command of Fort Scott, and readied it for the war times. The United States Army also took over several blocks within the town for commissary and quartermaster functions. The Union Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners. Troops from Indiana, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, and Wisconsin would come to the fort, and either stayed by the fort, or traveled farther, to subjugate Missouri, Arkansas, or the Indian Territory. Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the United States Colored Troops of the Union Army. A major supply depot was situated at the fort. Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town, but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek.", "text1": " A Virginian, he kept at least seven slaves at one time.

Both were working as clerks in the stores for the quartermaster and commissary. That they were employed as clerks is no surprise given that both were educated and literate young men. However, it does offer a glimpse into life for the black sons of those who worked in the fort. In order to work as clerks, they would have had to read and write. They were learning trades and jobs not normally reserved for the black children of Virginia. These jobs could possibly lead to better pay and more freedom. Most important, it meant that they were taking advantage of educational opportunities that were denied to black children in the rest of Virginia.\nAs much as families worked to maintain order and control over their enslaved workers, some slaves still made off with what they could.

{"prefix": "This view of Scientology as a public enemy, Seiwert adds, \"became a matter of political correctness\": senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology, and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social ostracism. Stephen A. Kent, writing in 1998, noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed.", "gold": "Scientology was viewed as \"a totalitarian, business-driven organization [...] guilty of significant human rights abuses.\" Officials examining primary and secondary sources, legal documents, and the testimony of former members, concluded that the organization was \"antithetical to a democratic state\". Federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology. Government publications on the dangers of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, in large part because of public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services. An area of widespread concern in the German media has been the alleged \"infiltration\" of businesses by Scientologists, in line with Scientology's declared aim to penetrate society, politics and business in preparation for world domination. Attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium-size companies, such as estate agents, management consultants and management-training companies. Management-consultancy firms led by Scientologists often conceal their association with Scientology; once they have recruited members of their clients' upper management, these managers may send employees to Scientology trainers, as part of company education and training programmes, without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used. An expensive commercial version of Scientology's Oxford Capacity Analysis, usually offered free as part of Scientology proselytizing in public places, temporarily entered some major German companies (who were unaware of its provenance) via such a management-consultancy firm. In the mid-2000s, German sect experts expressed concerns that Scientologists were becoming active in the German after-school tutoring market.", "text1": " However, while the desire to oppose and marginalize the group was near-universal in government, the means to achieve that goal were more varied. Some favored de facto restrictions, such as an official government \"blacklist\" of the church and its officials, and attempting to manipulate the media into attacking it. Others sought more formal means, such as having the church declared unconstitutional or criminal. \"One of the more common approaches was to present various church organizations and all of their leaders as being all one organization, thus ignoring the difference between the quasi-religious entities (known in German as 'F\u00f6rderverein') and the non-religious ones (known as 'Verein').\"\nAfter a careful examination of the German situation, Kent was skeptical of the value of much of this activity. \"In almost all these efforts,\" he wrote, \"the Germans have applied the same sort of paranoia against Scientology as the FBI did during the J Edgar Hoover years,\" while the German government was displaying a \"schizophrenic\" attitude towards free speech and religious freedom on the one hand, while trying to restrict the activities of Scientology on the other. However, Kent also added, \"The whole matter [was] much more complicated\" than this summary suggests.", "text2": " According to Kent and Seiwert, the only groups whose activities could be more severely restricted were the terrorist groups known at that time to exist in Germany.

After Spanish friar Andr\u00e9s de Avenda\u00f1o became lost in the Pet\u00e9n forests in early 1696 he described a ruin that may well have been Tikal. As is often the case with huge ancient ruins, knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people never forgot about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto M\u00e9ndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Pet\u00e9n, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s. In 1951, a small airstrip was built at the ruins, which previously could only be reached by several days' travel through the jungle on foot or mule. In 1956 the Tikal project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area.

In life the lobsters are blue, only becoming \"lobster red\" on cooking. Mating occurs in the summer, producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae. Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food, and is widely caught using lobster pots, mostly around the British Isles. Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean, with a body length up to and weighing up to , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually long and weigh . Like other crustaceans, lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow, in a process called ecdysis (molting). This may occur several times a year for young lobsters, but decreases to once every 1\u20132 years for larger animals. The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large, asymmetrical pair of feet. The larger one is the \"crusher\", and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the \"cutter\", which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. Usually, the left claw is the crusher, and the right is the cutter. The exoskeleton is generally blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment. The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap. The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics: The rostrum of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in H. gammarus.

The High Five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail, named the Cottonwood Trail, which runs under all levels of the interchange. The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by TxDOT. The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing, antiquated interchange that accommodated 500,000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in Dallas. It was a collaborative project between the TxDOT, affected motorists and property owners, and the primary contractor, Zachry Construction. An essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible. Reasons for upgrading the interchange, in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion, were to improve air quality, safety, and local access. Zachry Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $261 million contract by TxDOT, the largest ever by that agency. The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts.", "text1": " Moreover, the lack of bridges over Union Turnpike created difficulties in linking the surrounding neighborhoods.\nIn an effort to address the challenges that residents face in the area, the U.S. Department of Transportation initiated the 2012 Disadvantaged Business Enterprise National Performance Evaluation Program (Pulse Project).

Yet with the Phuoc Tuy province coming progressively under control throughout 1967, the Australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield. 1 ATF was subsequently deployed astride infiltration routes leading to Saigon to interdict communist movement against the capital as part of Operation Coburg during the 1968 Tet Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral\u2013Balmoral in May and June 1968. At Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare, ultimately fighting their largest, most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war. During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded, while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count, 60 possibly killed, 7 wounded and 11 captured. Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969, Hat Dich in late-December 1968 and early 1969 and Long Khanh in June 1971. At the height of the Australian commitment, 1 ATF numbered 8,500 troops, including three infantry battalions, armour, artillery, engineers, logistics and aviation units in support. A third RAAF unit, No. 2 Squadron RAAF, flying Canberra bombers, was sent in 1967, and four RAN destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam.

The task force then found itself fighting the largest battle of the entire Vietnam War, the Battle of Long Tan. While this battle has been described as the only major land action of the entire Vietnam War in which the Australian Army took the initiative and decisively defeated the Viet Cong, the Viet Cong's absence from the central and northern highlands prevented them from launching a major offensive in the south.[76]\nLong Tan Battlefield - Vietnam\nLong Tan Battlefield is a popular place to go for outdoor activities including mountain biking, rock climbing, bird watching, camping, picnicking, swimming, and kayaking.

His father is a literary agent. His mother is a casting agent and was involved in several films for the BBC, including The Inspector Lynley Mysteries and Walk Away and I Stumble. Radcliffe was educated at three independent schools for boys: Redcliffe School, a day school in Chelsea's Redcliffe Square; Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea's Cadogan Square; and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London's financial district (known as the City of London). Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first Harry Potter film. Some fellow pupils became hostile, though he says they were just trying to \"have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter\" rather than acting out of jealousy. As his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors. He admitted he was not a very good student, considering school useless and finding the work \"really difficult\". He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. \"The paparazzi, they'd love it\", he told Details magazine in 2007. \"If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were.\" Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at age five, and, aged ten, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield (1999), portraying the title character as a young boy. Radcliffe made his film debut in The Tailor of Panama (2001), an American film based on John le Carr\u00e9's 1996 spy novel, and a moderate commercial success. In 2000, producer David Heyman asked Radcliffe to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling book by British author J. K. Rowling. Rowling had been searching for an unknown British actor to personify the character, and the film's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, \"This is what I want.

Each main zone has its own visual style, and while some enemies appear throughout, each zone has unique enemies and obstacles. Each main zone is split into three acts, all of which must be completed. At the end of each main zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik for a boss fight. For most of the fights, Robotnik's vehicle is fitted with different weapons. After completing the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the single-level \"Final Zone\" for a last encounter with Robotnik inside a large machine environment. Destroying Robotnik's machine ends the game. A brief animation shows Sonic's return to the first zone, with animals liberated from Dr. Robotnik. Optionally, if Sonic reaches the end of any zone's Act 1 or Act 2 while holding at least 50 rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a \"special stage\". In the Special Stages, Sonic is continually curled up in his Spin Attack animation, and bounces off the bumpers and walls of a fully rotating maze.", "text1": " It may be performed in mid-air by jumping and spinning without pressing another button. This is Sonic's most common and useful attack.\nAdditionally, after jumping off of a spring or a slope, or after being launched by a spring in the air, Sonic may curl into a ball while flying in order to maintain his momentum and speed, extending his jumps and allowing him to maneuver freely in the air for a limited time.\nHe can curl into a ball by either jumping or rolling, and spin while in the air. When spinning, he can perform Homing Attack by pressing the Circle Button. He can also curl into a ball by jumping and pressing the X Button to perform an Homing Attack. His attack has homing capabilities against certain enemies. He can also spin dash, by pressing the Left and Right Buttons at the same time. Unlike other Sonic characters, his homing attack has to be activated in order to deal any damage.\nSonic also has Super Spin Dash, which is obtained after getting 50 or more Rings and pressing and holding down the L2 Button, the R2 Button, and the Right Stick. He spins rapidly as a normal Spin Dash would, but the momentum is boosted and his speed is increased to his Super form. Upon colliding with an enemy, object or wall, Sonic will immediately perform a dash through them. Pressing the Left Stick in any direction in the air will cause Sonic to land on his feet, which can be used as an anti-air attack.", "text2": " Sonic may perform a Spin Dash by rolling into a ball while stationary and charging a small distance. While in the Spin Dash form, the player has complete maneuverability of Sonic, who can steer the attack left, right or directly forward, or halt abruptly.\nIn the first game, the player can only perform a Spin Dash from a stationary position or from a slow run. The player can only execute it successfully from a slow run if the player presses the jump button just after they press the Spin Dash key (that button varies among different releases of the game; on most versions, the Spin Dash key is both \"Down\" and \"Start\" at the same time).\nIn the remade 2005 Sonic the Hedgehog (with several small elements from Sonic the Hedgehog CD introduced into the gameplay) the player still cannot perform a Spin Dash from a slow run. The player has complete maneuverability of Sonic, who can steer the Spin Dash around corners and pits. The player has less control when going faster, in the same way as the player had less control when going faster in the Mega Drive games, and slower while going faster in the Game Gear version.\nLater, the Sonic Advance series introduced improved versions called Spin Jump and Homing Attack, while Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 used similar homing abilities as part of their lock-on targeting systems (with an added aerial technique for flight when given boost shoes) for ring collecting.", "text3": "Sonic can execute a Spin Dash by curling into a ball and building up momentum while not moving. The player can control Sonic's direction and speed while he is in Spin Dash form. In the initial game, the player is limited to executing a Spin Dash either when Sonic is not moving or when he is moving slowly. To successfully perform a Spin Dash from a slow run, the player must press the jump button immediately after pressing the Spin Dash key, which may vary depending on the game version. The 2005 remake Sonic can perform a Spin Dash by rolling into a ball and gaining momentum while stationary or moving slowly. Even with elements from Sonic the Hedgehog CD, players are still unable to execute a Spin Dash from a slow run. Players can fully control Sonic's movement during the Spin Dash, allowing them to navigate corners and avoid obstacles. Players have reduced control at higher speeds, similar to the decreased control at higher speeds in the Mega Drive games and slower speeds in the Game Gear version.

However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it (which was flying a truce flag), and it was not delivered until the next day. That same day, Clinton began landing 2,200 troops on Long Island. The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6 km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at the northern end of Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan. General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17. An attempt to wade the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder-deep, too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition. He considered using boats to ferry the troops across, but the Americans, with timely advice from General Lee, adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position. As a result, the British and American forces faced each other across the channel, engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range. Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have \"the glory of being defeated alone.\" The attack was originally planned for June 24, but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days.", "text1": " They were drawn up on a plain behind the settlement and were observed by Marescot from the batteries of Fort Matilda. When the general arrived at the camp, he was informed of the enemy's movements, and as there was no prospect of immediately attacking them, resolved to try a night attack on their camp, at 11:00 pm on April 26, a similar stratagem to that at the battle of St. Cast (1758) on the night of 11\u201312 July 1758. In this, the British would approach in two columns of about 3,000 men, one column taking Fort Verte and the other the heights which commanded the camp. One half of the army, under the command of Colonel James Grant of Ballindalloch, the other, under Brigadier General William Boisseleau, the commander of the expedition. Grant was to march along the shore and cross the river, then to pass in front of Fort Verte, on the opposite side, before falling on the camp. Boisseleau was to descend the river in boats, at a point between Fort Verte and the camp, and cross the river above the camp, where he would join Grant. It was arranged that, at the moment of attack, boats were to be sent from the camp down to the heights which Boisseleau's column was to occupy, to distract the enemy's attention, and give him time to reach his position unobserved.", "text2": " These troops were equipped with the same brass cartridge case smooth-bored musket the British Regular Army used, and nearly all the British officers were veterans of the Seven Years War and more proficient in the use of European tactics than in any other.

The Knights went on to defeat the Vancouver College Fighting Irish 48\u20130 in the Grade 8 B.C. championship game, where McCarty scored another three touchdowns. The following year, McCarty joined the senior team at St. Thomas More, skipping the junior team entirely. He continued in his role as a running back while switching to the secondary defensively. Despite being a rare Grade 9 player on the senior team, he was one of the Knights' two leading rushers that year. McCarty scored a touchdown in the AAA B.C. championship game, helping the Knights win their first senior title as they beat the Pinetree T-Wolves 29\u20136. While K.C.

Duggan, along with Joe Thalasso, had exceptional running skills and became a standout fullback during that era. The Colts Grand Slam in 1989-1990 was an impressive accomplishment.

Sonic Team also intended to include a sound test with animations of Sonic breakdancing to a band of animal characters; including a crocodile keyboardist who was later introduced into the series as Vector the Crocodile in Knuckles' Chaotix in 1995. The sound test was scrapped for time reasons and Naka used the freed up memory to add the \"Se-ga!\" chant used in TV commercials as a startup sound. Naka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code. Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty. Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier.

He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably, his reasons were political. The Democrats were dominant in the region, and he wanted to avoid challenging his own party. By collecting some old US Civil War debts from the federal government, Beckham also virtually eliminated the state's debt. Encouraged by the state's improved finances, the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state's normal schools: Western State Teachers College in Bowling Green (later Western Kentucky University) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond (later part of Eastern Kentucky University). With a successful legislative session behind him, Beckham made a bold political move in June 1906. He orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November, a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. Beckham wanted the Senate seat, and if the primary was moved up two years, he could secure his party's nomination while he was still governor. He could also use his influence as governor to sway the party's choice of his potential successor as governor. State Auditor Samuel Wilbur Hager was Beckham's choice for governor and easily won the early primary over challenger N.B. Hays. Former Governor James B. McCreary challenged Beckham for the senatorial nomination, but Beckham won by more than 11,000 votes. Beckham's term as governor ended on December 10, 1907. In January 1908, he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the US Senate by virtue of the primary that had been held two years earlier. The Republicans nominated former Governor William O. Bradley. On the first ballot, Beckham secured 66 of the needed 69 votes; Bradley received 64 votes. Seven Democrats had not voted for Beckham. Over the next six weeks, 25 more votes were taken, with neither man securing a majority, even though William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee for president, campaigned for Beckham. Some Democrats pressured Beckham to withdraw and to allow a more palatable Democrat to run, but he refused. On the 29th ballot, taken near the end of February 1908, Bradley finally secured a majority, after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him.

This rendered large-scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the Mivo; meanwhile, the Japanese continued to harass the Australians, probing their positions and setting mines and traps, targeting the Australian line of communications. On 9 July, the 15th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around Siskatekori, at the junction of the Mivo River and the Buin Road, which included a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment. Australian patrols were resumed in late July and continued into August. These attacks proved very costly, particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding. Fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also, and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards Buin continued into August, combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed. As a result, the final Australian operations on Bougainville took place on the Ratsua front in the northern sector, where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at Porton Plantation had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the Bonis Peninsula. By mid-August, however, following the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japan's subsequent unconditional surrender, a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this, it spelt an end to major combat operations.

The new routing took US 2 along the lakeshore into St. Ignace. US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M\u2011122. Further changes in the early 1940s straightened the roadway out near Watersmeet and Crystal Falls. Additional realignments were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern lakeshore routing between Gould City and Epoufette in 1941. The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to Naubinway and then along the lake to Epoufette. The former route through Engadine was turned back to local control as far east as Garnet. From there east, it was numbered just M\u201148, removing US 2 from a concurrency. Another former section into Epoufette was added to extend M\u2011117. The new highway was detoured around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II.

The conflict was over by 1864, and the Waikato Regiments disbanded in 1867. However, many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade, while many others had returned to Australia. From 1870 until 1901, each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the 1870s\u2014including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units\u2014they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense.

Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century, with the colonies raising contingents to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China. Despite a reputation of colonial inferiority, many of the locally raised units were highly organised, disciplined, professional, and well trained. During this period, defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery, based on garrisoned coastal forts.

Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of , although not normally deeper than .

These include crabs, molluscs, sea urchins, starfish and polychaete worms. The three clawed lobster species Homarus gammarus, H. americanus and Nephrops norvegicus are hosts to the three known species of the animal phylum Cycliophora; the species on H. gammarus has not been described. Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease gaffkaemia, caused by the bacterium Aerococcus viridans. Although it is frequently found in American lobsters, the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus, where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out. Homarus gammarus is traditionally \"highly esteemed\" as a foodstuff and was mentioned in \"The Crabfish\" a seventeenth century English folk song. It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh, frozen, canned or powdered. Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain \"excellent\" white meat, and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible. The exceptions are the gastric mill and the \"sand vein\" (gut). The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus, and the European species is considered to be more flavored.

{"prefix": "The early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city, known only as the \"Lady of Tikal\", who was very likely a daughter of Chak Tok Ich'aak II. She seems never to have ruled in her own right, rather being partnered with male co-rulers.", "gold": "The first of these was Kaloomte' B'alam, who seems to have had a long career as a general at Tikal before becoming co-ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence. The Lady of Tikal herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering. It appears she was later paired with lord \"Bird Claw\", who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler. In the mid 6th century, Caracol seems to have allied with Calakmul and defeated Tikal, closing the Early Classic. The \"Tikal hiatus\" refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large-scale construction at Tikal. In the latter half of the 6th century AD, a serious crisis befell the city, with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture. This hiatus in activity at Tikal was long unexplained until later epigraphic decipherments identified that the period was prompted by Tikal's comprehensive defeat at the hands of Calakmul and the Caracol polity in AD 562, a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of Tikal. The badly eroded Altar 21 at Caracol described how Tikal suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in April 562. It seems that Caracol was an ally of Calakmul in the wider conflict between that city and Tikal, with the defeat of Tikal having a lasting impact upon the city. Tikal was not sacked but its power and influence were broken. After its great victory, Caracol grew rapidly and some of Tikal's population may have been forcibly relocated there. During the hiatus period, at least one ruler of Tikal took refuge with Janaab' Pakal of Palenque, another of Calakmul's victims. Calakmul itself thrived during Tikal's long hiatus period.

There is no record of a direct heir and it is possible that one was removed by assassination. Certainly his tomb was disturbed by later rulers and the central shrine destroyed, a crime even by the standards of Tikal where the destruction of monuments and even the dismemberment of kings was a relatively common activity.\nThe Lady of Tikal, possibly Chak Tok Ich'aak II's daughter, came to power, either as a mother or widow of Mutal Ach' Chan K'awil or even one of his sons and with her came the male co-ruler Siyaj Chan K'awil, the only son of Ahn Shok II.

{"prefix": "The oldest parts of Capel Lligwy date from the first half of the 12th century. This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north-west Wales were first built in stone following the end of Viking raids and attempts by the Normans to gain control of the island.", "gold": "The reason for its construction, and the saint to whom it was dedicated, are unknown. Geraint Jones, author of a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey, suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel, or connected to a royal court nearby. Yates and Longley, authors of a 2001 guide to ancient Anglesey monuments, note that it was built in the large parish of Penrhos Lligwy and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times. Despite this, it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right. The chapel is sometimes referred to as \"Hen Gapel Lligwy\" (\"hen\" being the Welsh word for \"old\" and \"capel\" meaning \"chapel\"). The walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century, and the upper parts of the walls date from this time. A chapel was added to the south side of the building in the 16th century. A vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family, the Pierce Lloyds. In 1999, the vault was used to record some \"atmospheres\" for the album \"You Have Just Been Poisoned By The Serpents\" by The Serpents, a collective of Welsh musicians including members of Echo and the Bunnymen, Super Furry Animals and Ectogram that was described by one journalist as \"possibly the strangest pop group of all time\". For a time, Capel Lligwy was used as a private place of worship for Lligwy House, a \"venerable mansion\" once owned by the Lloyd family which came into the possession of William Irby, 1st Baron Boston, in the 18th century. After the early part of the 18th century, however, the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair. The walls remain to gable level, with some traces of render on the inside, but the roof has gone. Capel Lligwy is in the Anglesey countryside near Llanallgo; the parish church of St Gallgo, Llanallgo is about away. Part of the churchyard wall remains, showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure, as often found with early churches.", "text1": " Most early medieval churches in Wales were simple \u2018quadrangular\u2019 or \u2018cruciform\u2019 buildings with a low square tower at the crossing of the nave and chancel arms. In the east end of the building a higher chancel projected from the body of the church.\nCapel Lligwy has an aisled nave and chancel of 7 bays. The low tower, which was built when the church was erected, has been filled in. Its doorway is blocked and the doorways to the church are set within the walls of the tower.\nThe church is thought to have had a large round chancel arch until the early 17th century. This was replaced by a flat arch with a similar arrangement of ribs but with a heavy moulded cornice.\nThe church was restored by Thomas Lloyd in 1908 and 1922-3. Thomas Lloyd was the 19th century ecclesiastical architect who became surveyor for the Church in Wales in 1909. He was responsible for many late Gothic style churches on Anglesey and for much of the restoration of medieval churches in the county. He was a proponent of the so-called \u2018Gothic Revival\u2019 which influenced the design of many Welsh churches until the 1970s.

Originally a chapel dedicated to St. Michael the archangel in honour of an ancient well on the nearby Llys Rhosyr farm, the ancient pattern of the chapel's plan follows the pattern of early Christian monuments, of which there are many in the region around Llys Rhosyr.\nLittle remains of the old buildings, with the present interior being formed in the mid 19th-century when former outbuildings were brought into use to enlarge and improve Capel Gwyngalch. The old lead-lined font with a base and shaft of granite (late 11th or 12th-century), is likely to be the oldest object remaining.

In its original American broadcast, \"Training Day\" was viewed by an estimated 7.871 million viewers and received a 4.0 rating/11% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 4.0% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast.

She also went on to criticize Jim, Pam and Dwight's reaction to Deangelo as the new manager, particular that of Jim and Pam, writing that \"it's becoming painfully obvious that the longtime writers don't know what to do with them anymore\".

He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on Calakmul when, in 695, he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered. After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory. By the 7th century, there was no active Teotihuacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had been razed by 700. Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style.

In 738, Quirigu\u00e1, a vassal of Cop\u00e1n, Tikal's key ally in the south, switched allegiance to Calakmul, defeated Cop\u00e1n and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Cop\u00e1n. In the 8th century, the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis. By the late 8th century and early 9th century, activity at Tikal slowed. Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers. By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence.

Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto M\u00e9ndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Pet\u00e9n, visited it in 1848.", "gold": "Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s. In 1951, a small airstrip was built at the ruins, which previously could only be reached by several days' travel through the jungle on foot or mule. In 1956 the Tikal project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area. From 1956 through 1970, major archaeological excavations were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania Tikal Project. They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures. Excavations directed by Edwin M. Shook and later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from 1957 to 1969. The Tikal Project recorded over 200 monuments at the site. In 1979, the Guatemalan government began a further archeological project at Tikal, which continued through to 1984. Filmmaker George Lucas used Tikal as a filming location for the fictional planetary moeleased Star Wars film, Episode IV: A New Hope, which premiered in 1977.StarWars.com Temple I at Tikal was featured on the reverse of the 50 centavo banknote. Eon Productions used the site for the James Bond film Moonraker. Tikal is now a major tourist attraction surrounded by its own national park. A site museum has been built at Tikal; it was completed in 1964. Tikal has been partially restored by the University of Pennsylvania and the government of Guatemala. It was one of the largest of the Classic period Maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the Americas. The architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over high, large royal palaces, in addition to a number of smaller pyramids, palaces, residences, administrative buildings, platforms and inscribed stone monuments.Drew 1999, p.183.", "text1": " M\u00e9ndez called it \u201cthe most remarkable spot in the forests of Pet\u00e9n,\u201d an opinion shared by Antonio Caba\u00f1as in 1850, but it was not until 1854 that Antonio P\u00edo Araujo found the first intact temple, (on his third visit to Tikal, he thought he had discovered the city of Cantemal). Some small scale looting of the site by treasure-hunters took place in the early 20th century, notably by Salvador Valiente and H\u00e9ctor L\u00f3pez Falc\u00f3n, who tried to clear the ruins for a proposed temple building by the end of the decade.\nThe first official exploration of the site took place in 1955 when Michael D. Coe, Thomas Gann and William R. Coe visited the site to make detailed observations. Coe's reconstructions of the site were included in his book, Tikal: An Expanded Guide, published in 1967.\nAs part of a larger initiative by the Guatemalan government to attract foreign tourists to the country, the first site tours were offered starting in 1956, and these were led by a local guide known as \"Bill Stephens\" who had been a merchant marine during World War II and who accompanied the American explorers of 1955. By 1958, a small tourist business developed in the town of Santa Elena, and Coe made his site surveys during that year as part of an archaeological expedition sponsored by Cornell University.", "text2": " They explored some of the ancient temples for the first time in recorded history, and carved their names into the stone.

Morley, Richard S. Garret, and William R. Coe began regular visits beginning in the mid-1930's. The initial clearing by hand of some of the gigantic forest growth covering Tikal began at about the same time. Prior to the construction of the airport there, Coe's party climbed to the top of Temple 33 on the East Plaza, overlooking the Central Acropolis, during a rainy night in January 1948.\nAfter many years of sporadic activity, the Tikal National Park (known as the Parque Nacional de Tikal), was established on the 15th anniversary (1965) of the Guatemalan Revolution, with a permanent staff to protect and preserve the park and its natural and anthropological resources, including some of the threatened monkey, iguana, and bird populations which inhabit Tikal.

{"prefix": "Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style. Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1.", "gold": "These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today. In 738, Quirigu\u00e1, a vassal of Cop\u00e1n, Tikal's key ally in the south, switched allegiance to Calakmul, defeated Cop\u00e1n and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Cop\u00e1n. In the 8th century, the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis. By the late 8th century and early 9th century, activity at Tikal slowed. Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers. By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once-great power was little more than a memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem glyph.

Richmond grew up in Ashland, Ohio. His parents, Al and Evelyn (n\u00e9e Warner) Richmond, met in the course of their work. Al was a welder for pipe construction companies and Evelyn was a field office manager. Noticing that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe, Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway. To market this invention, he founded Richmond Manufacturing, which eventually exported machines worldwide. Tim's driving days started as a toddler when he was given a go-kart that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn. He later raced the kart at tracks in Moreland and New Pittsburg. Richmond grew up in a well-to-do family, and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates, so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami, Florida. During his years in Miami, Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio. While home in Ohio over a summer break, he met local drag racer Raymond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller. When Richmond reached age 16, his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am, a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said, \"Tim was lazy...\", and \"... I did everything for him. I ruined him, I admit it. He was my whole life.\" Richmond excelled in sports; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his gridiron days were over. Miami Military Academy named him Athlete of the Year in 1970. Richmond's other interests included flying, and he earned his private pilot license at age 16. Following high school graduation, Richmond attended Ashland University for about one year before dropping out. A friend of Richmond's father co-owned a sprint car and Richmond joined the team as a crew member for Dave Shoemaker. In 1976, 21-year-old Richmond took the car onto Lakeville Speedway at Lakeville, Ohio for some practice laps. \"Somebody put a stopwatch on me,\" Richmond said. \"I was running laps faster than Dave had been. It was the first time I had ever driven a race car.\"", "text1": " \"He fit right in.\" There was never any pretense about Richmond.

As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal, and 1 ATF ceased operations in October. Meanwhile, the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of Gough Whitlam. The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973. The Vietnam War was Australia's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support, as the nation's military involvement increased a vocal anti-war movement developed. More than 50,000 Australians served in Vietnam; 519 were killed and 2,398 were wounded. Four were awarded the Victoria Cross. Although the importance of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The Whitlam Labor Government subsequently amalgamated the five defence ministries (Defence, Navy, Army, Air Force, and Supply) into a single Department of Defence in 1973, while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished. On 1 January 1976, the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified, all-volunteer, professional force known as the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Today, the ADF is headquartered at Russell Offices in Canberra and is divided into Air, Land, Maritime and Special Operations Commands. In addition, Northern Command is based in Darwin, and is responsible for operations in Northern Australia.

The RAAF's move into jet aircraft started in 1948, when two of the three Mustang squadrons were re-equipped with Lockheed P-80A Shooting Stars, purchased for the RAAF as a stop-gap measure until more modern jets could be obtained. At the end of 1949 the Canadian government invited the Australian Government to participate in its development of a jet-powered transport aircraft. After completing the flight tests the Sabre was declared 'fit and suitable' for military service and delivered to the RAAF in May 1953. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the RAAF was involved in border protection duties in the region. From June 1940 RAAF operated 67 out of 127 aircraft, the other 60 being supplied by the United Kingdom, 50 of them Supermarine Spitfires for home defence.

The ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended. Edson and Thomas tried to persuade Vandegrift to move forces to defend the ridge, but Vandegrift refused, believing that the Japanese were more likely to attack along the coast. Finally, Thomas convinced Vandegrift that the ridge was a good location for Edson's Raiders to \"rest\" from their actions of the preceding month. On 11 September, the 840 men of Edson's unit\u2014including the 1st Raiders and the Paramarines\u2014deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it.

On 9 September, Kawaguchi's troops left the coast at Koli Point. Split into four columns, they marched into the jungle towards their predesignated attack points south and southeast of the airfield. Lack of good maps, at least one faulty compass, and thick, almost impenetrable jungle caused the Japanese columns to proceed slowly and zigzag, costing a lot of time. At the same time, Oka's troops approached the Lunga perimeter from the west. Oka had some intelligence on the Marine defenses, extracted from a U.S. Army pilot captured on 30 August. During the day of 12 September, Kawaguchi's troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night's attacks. Kawaguchi wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by 14:00, but they did not reach their assembly areas until after 22:00. Oka was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west. Only the Kuma battalion reported that they were in place on time. Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions, Kawaguchi was still confident in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses.

Roosevelt ordered the War and Navy departments to prepare plans to take the fight to the enemy. Lejeune was on the scene, and he knew exactly what to do with his Marines: occupy Guadalcanal. The operation would also provide an opportunity to launch a powerful blow against the Japanese in their advance toward Australia.

{"prefix": "Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by programmer Yuji Naka. Sonic the Hedgehog was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay.", "gold": "It was also commercially successful, establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. The game has been ported a number of times, and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media. It is often cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrolling\u2013platform video game. The gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. The levels are populated with hazards in the form of robots inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Destroying a robot frees the creature, but is not necessary to complete the game. The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by moving walls or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents. Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rapidly spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or by rolling on the ground. At the start of the game, the player is given three lives, each of which may be lost if Sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects while in possession of no rings, falls to the bottom of the level screen, or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Signposts act as checkpoints to allow Sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life. The time resets when he returns to the checkpoint. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player may return to the beginning of the act with three lives if the player has any continues. Scattered around each level are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings act as a layer of protection against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, all his rings will scatter. He can recollect some of them again before they disappear. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life.", "text1": " It has been included in several lists of the greatest video games of all time, and is regarded as one of the best platform games ever created.

{"prefix": "Tikal and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbat\u00fan region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.", "gold": "In the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much-diminished city of Tikal, as evidenced by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by Jasaw Chan K'awiil II in 869. This was the last monument erected at Tikal before the city finally fell into silence. The former satellites of Tikal, such as Jimbal and Uaxactun, did not last much longer, erecting their final monuments in 889. By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal's population had deserted the city, its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city's ceremonial plazas. The squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non-utilitarian items such as musical instruments. These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities, far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them. Some monuments were vandalized and some were moved to new locations. Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared, with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for jade and the easier-to-find tombs were looted. After 950, Tikal was all but deserted, although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed among the ruins. Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the rainforest claimed the ruins for the next thousand years. Some of Tikal's population may have migrated to the Peten Lakes region, which remained heavily populated in spite of a plunge in population levels in the first half of the 9th century. The most likely cause of collapse at Tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure. The fall of Tikal was a blow to the heart of Classic Maya civilization, the city having been at the forefront of courtly life, art and architecture for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty.", "text1": " Tikal appears to have lost its political independence during the first half of the Terminal Classic, and became a tributary state to the new hegemon in the central Pet\u00e9n, Dos Pilas (Blom 2000). During the Terminal Classic Tikal may also have suffered from a low-density settlement pattern in the surrounding region, a feature which can be found in some other Maya regions as well (e.g. the Mirador basin; Beltr\u00e1n and Vald\u00e9s 2003).", "text2": " The evidence from Tikal as to the causes and mechanisms of the collapse are therefore rather different from those of the nearby southern lowlands.\nDue primarily to the emergence of the Classic Lowland Long Count texts and to Tikal research from this last century, the reconstruction of the cultural development in the Classic Period in Guatemala's Petexbatun region, and particularly at Tikal National Park, has been widely accepted.\nIn the four hundred years following 100 AD in the Tikal National Park, the Classic Lowlands Maya continued to build a predominantly agrarian society with strong centralised religious institutions and ever increasing environmental stress. Both Tikal National Park and its neighboring regions of the north Petexbatun region suffered in part due to the already over stretched resources of the environment, in particular of the limited soil. During times of periodic droughts the Classic Lowlands Maya were affected not least by a reduced amount of rainfall which resulted in water shortages.\nAnother environmental stress factor resulting not from a reduced water supply, but the deterioration in its quality, is evidenced by a rise in arid pollen at Tikal National Park which indicates higher levels of dust and therefore pollution. Both of theses factors combined - water shortages and air pollution - contributed to the collapse of the Classic Lowlands Maya society at Tikal National Park.", "text3": "The evidence from Tikal suggests different causes and mechanisms for the collapse compared to the nearby southern lowlands. The cultural development in the Petexbatun region during the Classic Period, including Tikal National Park, has been widely accepted thanks to recent research and discoveries. Between 100 AD and four hundred years later, the Classic Lowlands Maya in Tikal National Park developed a mainly agricultural society with centralized religious institutions and faced growing environmental challenges. Tikal National Park and the nearby north Petexbatun region both experienced resource depletion, especially in terms of limited soil. Periodic droughts impacted the Classic Lowlands Maya by reducing rainfall and causing water shortages. Increased arid pollen levels at Tikal National Park suggest a rise in dust and pollution due to deteriorating water quality, rather than a decrease in water supply.

The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song. For the next dozen years, they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land, which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India. The Mongols set up military garrisons, manned mostly by Turkic-speaking Muslims from Central Asia, in 37 circuits of the former Dali Kingdom. By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward appearances of calmness, had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258\u201360 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy. The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols. When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy.", "text1": " They both represented some sort of leader of the imperial world, of which both had great influence.

During this time, there were local incidents of murder and attempted arson, typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting. During the American Civil War, the fort was renewed as a US military post. In August 1861, the Union Army took command of Fort Scott, and readied it for the war times. The United States Army also took over several blocks within the town for commissary and quartermaster functions. The Union Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners. Troops from Indiana, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, and Wisconsin would come to the fort, and either stayed by the fort, or traveled farther, to subjugate Missouri, Arkansas, or the Indian Territory. Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the United States Colored Troops of the Union Army. A major supply depot was situated at the fort. Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town, but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek. The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern-sympathizing area and close to the Confederate state of Arkansas and the \"unstable\" Indian Territory (present-day state of Oklahoma), where many of the members of the Five Civilized Tribes were allied with the Confederates. The fort served as a \"general hospital\" (large military hospital) and prison until after the war. Following the end of the war, in October 1865 the US Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled. On January 14, 1870, the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas. The Post was based at Fort Scott, but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks, and seldom used the original fort. They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers. Some of the latter feared that the railroad, which had been awarded land for development by the US Government in rights-of-way, would evict them from their squatter homes. The settlers considered the troops lackeys to the railroads, and lumped both as enemies. Settlers also had some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurgents using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery.

{"prefix": "Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period. The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains.", "gold": "The oval-shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the Oregon\u2013Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains. It is about long and wide. The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene. A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure. The caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago. The caldera contains significant ore deposits, and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera. Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. The Trout Creek Mountains are semi-arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range, most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the Trout Creek Mountains. As a result, the average annual precipitation in the Trout Creek Mountains is only per year, with most areas receiving between annually. Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June. Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months. Snowpack at elevations below usually melts by April; however, at the higher elevations, snow can remain until mid-June. Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the snowpack melts. The prevailing winds are from the west-southwest, and they are normally strongest in March and April. Brief, intense thunderstorms are common between April and October. Thunderstorms in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes. Vegetation in the Trout Creek Mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses. Other common shrubs include bitterbrush, snowberry, and Ceanothus. There are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas. Common grass species include Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, cheatgrass, western needlegrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail, as well as basin wildrye in some well-drained areas. Less than one percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian greenways (vegetation along stream banks). However, these areas are vital to the local ecosystem.", "text1": " The low topographic elevation suggests that the surrounding area is much younger, and its inflection suggests that the underlying structure is a bowl shaped with its opening on the east side. The largest moraine of the valley is found where U.S. Route 20 parallels the valley, and the nature of the rock is believed to point to the presence of a mountain much larger than the Trout Creek Mountains.\n\nTrout Creek is a tributary of the Malheur River located in Malheur County, Oregon.

The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home Unions over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB).

Ireland, Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891, when, following arbitration, the RFU relented and joined the IRFB.

{"prefix": "At the fort, Moultrie ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man-of-war ships, Bristol and Experiment, which took hit after hit from the fort's guns. Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main- and mizzenmasts.", "gold": "One round hit her quarterdeck, slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh. The shot also tore off part of his britches, leaving his backside exposed. By mid-afternoon, the defenders were running out of gunpowder, and their fire was briefly suspended. However, Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland, and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day, telling Colonel Moultrie, \"I see you are doing very well here, you have no occasion for me, I will go up to the town again.\" Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort's walls with persistent broadside cannonades. This strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions; the structure would quiver, and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering. The exchange continued until around 9:00 pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range. At one point during the battle, the flag Moultrie had designed and raised over the fort was shot down. Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again, holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided. He was credited by Moultrie with reviving the troops' spirits, and later given commendations for bravery. A painting of this event (pictured above) depicts Jasper's actions. Counting casualties, Parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard Bristol, which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to the hull, yards, and rigging. Experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded. Active and Solebay reported 15 casualties each. The Americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded. The following morning, the British, unable to drag the grounded Acteon off the sandbar, set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Patriots in small boats sailed out to the burning ships, and fired some of their cannons at the British ships, took what stores and loot they could, and retreated shortly before the ship's powder magazine exploded. The British did not attempt to take the fort again.", "text1": " [18] On October 21, Parliament enacted a proclamation by which those who took refuge from English justice in either the American or West Indian colonies became liable to be arrested on return to England. On October 25, Royal Navy officers Col. William Moultrie published in the South Carolina Gazette that a bill of attainder against Gates had been read in Parliament. It is 25 75 feet long. The most fascinating and well known of the Pirate's Den Caves is the pirate's cave at Lime Kiln Bay which lies just 1.5 miles southeast of the Fort and was constructed on land deeded to Francis Marion by Robert B. Thompson in 1769. [24] Men from both armies foraged in the fields around the fort, tearing down fences, burning down homes, and trampling crops. These attacks, which were launched from swivel guns mounted on the fort's parapets, helped cover the retreat of South Carolina militia men from the surrounding Charleston peninsula, as well as from other outposts in the Charleston area. The 3.5-mile stretch of road that crosses Charleston Harbor, linking downtown to Mount Pleasant, has changed significantly since the American Revolution. [19], Simcoe took 300 cavalry to Clear Spring near St. George, where 200 militia were defeated, their stores and supplies captured, and a number taken prisoner. Colonel Moultrie had set up his heavy guns in a fortification he dubbed the \u201cSavannah Theatre.", "text2": " The Experiment also sustained damage. St. Augustine and Scarborough then closed on the fort, with St. Augustine firing a broadside. Experiment returned, but the British guns battered her back. The Experiment dragged her anchor (some reports say cut its cable) with the idea that she could rake the fort's works with grapeshot. However, the sail failed when their moorings in the shallow water prevented the grapple in the anchor end from taking effect.\nAlthough the South Carolinians were running low on gunpowder and morale among the ranks was low following news that General Charles Lee had surrendered Charleston's Fort Moultrie and, later on June 28, Sullivan Island (see below), morale at Moultrie's Fort was boosted upon news that British Captain Thomas Pride of the schooner Active had surrendered to rebel forces at St. Augustine, Florida. The South Carolinians still controlled the first part of the fort, from the deep magazine in the south battery to the flag staff in the north. The British flag was still visible from below. Once Pride had surrendered, a total of only seven Americans per battery were positioned to return the British fire from their assault. General Moultrie and Colonel William Thomson realized this, and they decided to cut the flag staff down. They knew if the British became alarmed that the flag was down, the British might try to take advantage of the confusion caused by the flag being cut down.", "text3": "The Experiment also experienced harm. St. Augustine and Scarborough approached the fort and St. Augustine fired a broadside. The British guns attacked Experiment as she returned. Experiment attempted to position itself to fire grapeshot at the fort by dragging its anchor or cutting its cable. The anchor was unable to hold due to the shallow water, causing the sail to fail. Despite low gunpowder supplies and morale, news of British Captain Thomas Pride's surrender to rebel forces in St. Augustine boosted morale at Moultrie's Fort. The South Carolinians maintained control over the southern battery to the northern flag staff within the fort. The British flag could still be seen from the lower position. After Pride surrendered, each battery only had seven Americans ready to fight back against the British attack. General Moultrie and Colonel William Thomson recognized the situation and made the decision to remove the flag staff. They were aware that the British could exploit the chaos resulting from the flag being removed if they noticed it was down.", "detect1": {"z_score": 0.2317137785453969, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.5067114093959731, "p_value": 0.40838016444192926}, "detect2": {"z_score": 14.934117803354168, "prediction": true, "green_fraction": 0.9407665505226481, "p_value": 9.883641180202458e-51}, "detect3": {"z_score": 3.7570703865441804, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.6331658291457286, "p_value": 8.595707710583982e-05}, "curr_idx": 499}
