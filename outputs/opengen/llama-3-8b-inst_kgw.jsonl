Oka's unit of about 650 men attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the Lunga perimeter. At about 04:00 on 14 September, two Japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (3/5) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses. Another Japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of 14 September. The rest of Oka's unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack. At 13:05 on 14 September, Kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle, where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day. Kawaguchi's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the Matanikau River valley to join with Oka's unit, a march over difficult terrain. Kawaguchi's troops began the march on the morning of 16 September. Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded. As the march progressed, the exhausted and hungry soldiers, who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal, began to discard their heavy equipment and then their rifles. By the time most of them reached Oka's positions at Kokumbona five days later, only half still carried their weapons. The Kuma battalion's survivors, attempting to follow Kawaguchi's Center Body forces, became lost, wandered for three weeks in the jungle, and almost starved to death before finally reaching Kawaguchi's camp. In total, Kawaguchi's forces lost about 830 killed in the attack, including 350 in Tamura's battalion, 200 in Kokusho's battalion, 120 in Oka's force, 100 in the Kuma battalion, and 60 in Watanabe's battalion. An unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the Matanikau.

If we can get some of our tanks back online, we might be able to pin down those Kuma troops and prevent another breakthrough.\"\n\nDavis nodded thoughtfully. \"Make it happen, Captain. And get word to our artillery to be ready to provide fire support. We're not going to let these Japanese take another chunk out of our lines without a fight.\"\n\nAs the Marines set to work, the sounds of battle began to fade into the distance, replaced by the distant rumble of artillery and the staccato bursts of small arms fire.

The repeated failures had weakened the battalion's morale, and many of the soldiers were now questioning the senselessness of the attack. Ito knew he had to come up with a plan to lift his troops' spirits and refocus their attention. With this goal in mind, he ordered his troops to construct makeshift shelters and gather firewood, in an effort to remind themselves of their training and preparation for combat.\n\nMeanwhile, the Marines on the other side of the river, having repelled the attack, were beginning to realize the extent of the Japanese losses. As the bodies of the Japanese soldiers floated to the surface, the Marines were shaken by the sheer scale of the devastation. The cry of the Japanese wounded, mixed with the stench of death, hung in the air, a stark reminder of the cost of war.\n\nBy dawn, the Japanese had set up a field hospital to tend to the survivors of the previous day's attacks, but it soon became clear that many of the wounded were too far gone to be saved. The Marines, sensing the Japanese army's disarray, prepared to launch a counterattack of their own, aiming to push the Japanese back further along the river and inflict even greater losses on them.", "text3": "After the final attacker returned to the Japanese lines, Lieutenant Colonel Ito gathered his officers to regroup and evaluate their situation. The battalion's morale was low due to the multiple unsuccessful attacks, leading to soldiers questioning the purpose of the mission. Ito realized he needed to devise a strategy to boost his soldiers' morale and redirect their focus. He instructed his soldiers to build temporary shelters and collect firewood to help them remember their training and readiness for battle. On the opposite side of the river, the Marines who had successfully defended against the attack were starting to understand the magnitude of the Japanese casualties. The Marines were deeply affected by the large number of Japanese casualties visible in the river. The sound of injured Japanese soldiers and the smell of death lingered in the air, serving as a grim reminder of the consequences of war. At dawn, the Japanese established a field hospital for the survivors of the previous day's attacks, only to realize that many of the wounded were beyond saving.

These granite outcrops are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic ridgelines. The Trout Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, which was then beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period. The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains. The oval-shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the Oregon\u2013Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains. It is about long and wide. The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene. A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure. The caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago. The caldera contains significant ore deposits, and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera. Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. The Trout Creek Mountains are semi-arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west.

After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations. True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919 but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times. The Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas that those industries were prominent, Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women's vote and by his support of Wilson, who had lost popularity since Beckham's election, in 1914. Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3% of the vote to Beckham's 49.7&%. During his only term in the Senate, Beckham served alongside three other US Senators from Kentucky: Ollie M. James, George B. Martin, and Augustus O. Stanley. After his term in the Senate ended, Beckham resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time, he had the support of the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful political machine, known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks. The Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated the Club's relatively-obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. Flem D.

Beckham's efforts paid off in 1917, when the US declared war on Germany and entered the conflict.\n\nIn addition to his work on military affairs, Beckham was also a key player in the development of the US highway system. He believed that a comprehensive network of highways was essential for the country's economic growth and national security, and he worked tirelessly to secure federal funding for highway construction projects. His efforts ultimately led to the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1916, which provided significant funding for the construction of highways across the United States.\n\nBeckham's commitment to public service and his impressive legislative record earned him widespread recognition and respect.

Meridian later honored Chaney by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service. Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985. Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown. This included construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997, based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian's Golden Age; it had been demolished. Other projects included renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann's Restaurant in 2002, as well as support for integrated urban design. Meridian Main Street, along with The Riley Foundation, helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the \"Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts.\" After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010. Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown.

The recording reflects the influence of glam rock on Starr through what authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter term \"its big drum sound and repetitious nature\". The line-up comprised Starr (vocals, drums, percussion), Harrison (guitars), Gary Wright (piano) and Klaus Voormann (bass, saxophone). Rodriguez describes Starr's \"martial-sounding opening\" as a rare \"showcase for his own drumming\", while Harrison biographer Simon Leng writes of \"a roaring series of Harrison slide breaks that brought to mind Duane Allman\". Starr later said that he incorporated a hook he had come up with for the Beatles song \"Get Back\" into his drum part on \"Back Off Boogaloo\". Further overdubs on the track included contributions from three backing vocalists, led by American soul singer Madeline Bell. For the single's B-side, Starr had already written and recorded \"Blindman\". It was intended to be the theme song for the Ferdinando Baldi-directed Spaghetti Western Blindman, filming for which Starr had interrupted in order to perform at the Concert for Bangladesh.

The recording sessions took place at Apple on 18\u201319 August, with Badfinger guitarist Pete Ham assisting Starr and Voormann. Like the film, \"Blindman\" was not held in high regard by critics. Spizer describes it as \"a muddy-sounding dirge with little to recommend\". By contrast, director and author Alex Cox believes that the song \"works well, in the context of the film\" compared to Cipriani's score, which he considers \"lazy\".", "text1": "However, upon reviewing the recording, Starr was dissatisfied with the results and decided to re-record the song in early 1972. This new version was completed by April of that year, with a more laid-back, Caribbean-inspired vibe that better suited his signature drumming style.

He invited Starr to play a solo on one of the tracks, a country-rock influenced song called \"Monkberry Moon Delight\". The collaboration brought the two friends closer together, and they spent many hours jamming at McCartney's home studio, throwing around ideas for future solo ventures.\n\nJohn Lennon, who was busy wrapping up his own work on his soon-to-be-released solo album Imagine, offered some sage advice to Starr: \"Remember, Ringo, the key to success lies not in the song, but in the way you perform it\". With his friend's words of wisdom in mind, Starr took the reins on the song, adding a dash of wit and humor to the lyrics, and his own signature backing vocals.\n\nThroughout the recording process, the camaraderie between the Beatles was palpable, and \"Back Off Boogaloo\" emerged as a testament to their enduring friendship and musical synergy.", "text3": "After finishing recording \"Back Off Boogaloo\", Starr was eager to show the lively track to his Beatles bandmates, who were still in a phase of uncertainty and trying new things. George Martin, the producer of Ringo's album, motivated Starr to include a memorable chorus in the song, resulting in the creation of the catchy \"Back off, ablow your top\" refrain. At the same time, Paul McCartney was busy with his solo project Ram and was pleased with an early version of \"Back Off Boogaloo\". Starr was asked to contribute a solo to a country-rock influenced track titled \"Monkberry Moon Delight\". Their collaboration strengthened their friendship, leading to numerous jam sessions at McCartney's home studio where they brainstormed ideas for upcoming solo projects.

Rather than give in to artistic blackmail, Gauthier quit opera entirely.", "gold": "Disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene, Gauthier departed Europe and travelled to Java. There, she met a Dutch importer and plantation manager named Frans Knoote. Gauthier and Knoote married on May 22, 1911. Gauthier studied the music of Java, and began to include this in her repertoire. Her accompanying pianist was Paul Seelig, who had previously been the conductor for the Kraton of Surakarta, which afforded Gauthier a number of opportunities. On permission of the Javanese court, she studied the gamelan, probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity. While living in Java, Gauthier travelled extensively, giving performances in China, Japan, Singapore, Malaya, Australia, and New Zealand. She remained in Java for four years, but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America, arriving in New York City in the fall of 1914. Arriving in New York, Gauthier struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene. She put on a performance in Vaudeville entitled Songmotion, which combined Javan music with dancers. New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers, so Gauthier focused on her Javan musical repertoire, which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing. Gauthier began giving annual recitals at Aeolian Hall, and in November 1917 her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers. She developed her own reputation quickly, known as a \"...sensitive purveyor of interesting, untried songs\". She gave renditions of three songs by Maurice Ravel. Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky's Three Japanese Lyrics and Griffes' Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan. The performance was a great success, and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers. Stravinsky arranged to have Gauthier to premiere all of his vocal pieces. Gauthier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America. Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel, she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him, but also with Erik Satie and Les Six. This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert.", "text1": "Devastated by the sudden loss of his lead soprano, Gauthier was forced to scramble to find a replacement.

Gauthier was taken aback by her talent and beauty, and despite the chaos and stress of the situation, he felt a spark of excitement.\n\nSophia, it turned out, was a prodigy from a small town in the countryside. She had been singing since childhood and had been discovered by a local opera company, where she had quickly risen through the ranks. Gauthier was impressed by her innocence, her passion, and her willingness to learn.\n\nWith Sophia on board, Gauthier was able to salvage the production, and the opera was a huge success. Sophia's performance was met with thunderous applause, and Gauthier was hailed as a genius for finding her.\n\nBut Tetrazzini, who had been watching from the shadows, was not pleased. She had expected Gauthier to beg for her forgiveness, to grovel at her feet and plead for her return. Instead, he had found a new star, one who was younger, prettier, and more talented than she.

She spent the next few months in solitude, re-examining her values and priorities as a performer. She began to question the commercial pressures and compromises she had tolerated in the opera world.\n\nEventually, Gauthier emerged from her seclusion with a plan. She would create a new ensemble, dedicated to performing repertoire that was both artistically challenging and meaningful. She would focus on chamber music and intimate opera, where the emphasis was on the storytelling and emotional authenticity, rather than grand spectacle.\n\nGauthier threw herself into the project, using her network of colleagues and mentors to assemble a talented team of performers.

Gershwin played the piano for these pieces. Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Virgil Thomson, and Paul Whiteman. Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music, the performance was overall a huge success, and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art. Gauthier continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences. On some occasions, such as her performances of Gershwin in New York in 1923 and 1925, as well as in London in 1925, this was quite successful. A critic in Vienna welcomed her musical selection as a reprieve from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert, Brahms, Wolf, Richard Strauss - while praising her skill with more classical choices. Other performances suffered \u2013 she was booed while performing works by Heitor Villa-Lobos at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in Venice.", "text1": "As Gauthier navigated the vibrant Parisian music scene, she found herself drawn to the avant-garde circles that revolved around Ravel, Satie, and Les Six. She attended countless salon concerts and soirees, where she would sit at the feet of these innovative composers, absorbing their philosophies and artistic visions like a sponge.\n\nRavel, particularly, took a liking to Gauthier's keen musical instincts and her determination to bring American audiences closer to the works of French masters. He began to confide in her about his own struggles to create music that was both accessible and innovative, and Gauthier found herself offering words of encouragement and insight, drawing from her own experiences as a promoter of new music in the United States.\n\nSatie, on the other hand, became a mentor of sorts to Gauthier, sharing with her his unique approach to music as a fusion of the avant-garde and the rustic. She would often accompany him on visits to the countryside, where they would attend folk festivals and absorb the rhythms and melodies of the French peasantry.\n\nThrough her relationships with these three visionaries, Gauthier gained a deeper understanding of the musical movements that were transforming Europe in the 1920s. She began to see the connections between the experimental works of Ravel and Satie, and the folk-inspired compositions of Les Six, and she envisioned a future where American audiences could experience these innovations firsthand.\n\nAs her tour of Maurice Ravel began to take shape, Gauthier knew that she had a responsibility to not only promote his music, but also to introduce the American public to the broader tapestry of French musical innovation. And so, she set her sights on organizing a series of concerts and recitals that would showcase the works of Ravel, Satie, and Les Six, alongside those of other avant-garde composers and performers. The task was daunting, but Gauthier was undaunted, knowing that she had the support of her new friends and the spark of a revolutionary idea to guide her.", "text2": "During her stay in Paris, Gauthier was in the midst of navigating the complex and storied history of the city's music scene. She would often attend impromptu concerts and salons hosted by Ravel, Satie, and their circle of avant-garde composer friends. The evenings were filled with spirited discussions, witty banter, and, of course, music that challenged the conventional norms of the time.\n\nGauthier found herself particularly drawn to the work of Darius Milhaud, who would often regale the group with tales of Brazilian folk music and its exotic rhythms. His passion was infectious, and before long, Gauthier found herself attending frequent sessions at Milhaud's cluttered atelier, where he would demonstrate complex polyrhythms and teach her to play his signature \"fox-trot\" melodies.\n\nMeanwhile, Erik Satie remained somewhat elusive, often vanishing for hours to work on his enigmatic compositions or attend to his latest mystical obsessions. Yet, whenever he deigned to join the group, the room was filled with his signature deadpan humor and a strange, otherworldly energy. Gauthier found herself both fascinated and perplexed by his eccentric genius.\n\nOne fateful evening, Les Six, the notorious group of composer friends \u2013 including Louis Durey, Georges Auric, and Arthur Honegger \u2013 gathered at Ravel's home to play a spirited game of poker. Gauthier, who had by now become a regular member of their circle, joined the group and was amazed by their quick wit and irreverent humor. As the night wore on, the conversation turned to the topic of American music, and they all begged Gauthier to regale them with stories of the emerging jazz scene back in the States.", "text3": "While in Paris, Gauthier was exploring the intricate and rich history of the city's music scene. She frequently went to spontaneous music events and gatherings organized by Ravel, Satie, and their group of innovative composer acquaintances. The nights were lively with lively conversations, clever jokes, and groundbreaking music. Gauthier was captivated by Darius Milhaud's stories about Brazilian folk music and its unique rhythms. Gauthier quickly became drawn into Milhaud's enthusiasm, leading her to regularly participate in music sessions at his busy studio where he shared intricate rhythms and instructed her on playing his distinctive \"fox-trot\" tunes. On the other hand, Erik Satie tended to be mysterious, disappearing for extended periods to focus on his enigmatic music or delve into his latest mystical interests. However, when he did decide to participate, his unique dry wit and mysterious aura filled the room. Gauthier was intrigued and puzzled by his unconventional brilliance. One evening, the group of composer friends known as Les Six, which included Louis Durey, Georges Auric, and Arthur Honegger, met at Ravel's house for a lively poker game. Gauthier, now a familiar face among them, was impressed by their sharp humor and playful attitude.

Afterwards, Carey sang \"Close My Eyes\", the only sitting performance of the show. During the song, several male backup dancers performed slow and ample dance routines behind Carey on a higher level of the stage. For the second part of the show, Carey had the second costume change of the evening, donning a long sequined black gown and semi-teased hair. For the performance of \"Dreamlover\", Carey was joined by three female back-up dancers, who mimicked her light dance routines during the song. The next song on the set-list was \"Hero\", which featured Carey alone on-stage, without any vocal back-up. After the song's performance, Carey was joined on-stage by Lorenz, who performed \"I'll Be There\" alongside her. Next came \"Make It Happen\", a song which accompanied yet another wardrobe change for Carey. She donned a short mini-skirt, alongside a sleeveless white blouse and loose golden curls. On-stage, Carey was joined by a full church choir, all dressed in long black garments. After the song's recital, Carey performed \"One Sweet Day\", alongside a previously recorded video of Boyz II Men during their live performance of the song with Carey at Madison Square Garden in 1995.

{"prefix": "Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which can be attributed to its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation. Mount Elbert was named by miners in honor of Samuel Hitt Elbert, the governor of the then-Territory of Colorado, because he brokered a treaty in September 1873 with the Ute tribe that opened up more than of reservation land to mining and railroad activity.", "gold": "The first recorded ascent of the peak was by H.W. Stuckle in 1874, who was surveying the mountain as part of the Hayden Survey. Originally measured as in height, Mount Elbert's elevation was later adjusted to following a re-evaluation of mapped elevations, which sparked protests. The actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the North American Vertical Datum of 1988; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level Datum of 1929. A matter of some contention arose after the Great Depression over the heights of Elbert and its neighbor Mount Massive, which differ in elevation by only . This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height, only to have the Mount Elbert proponents demolish them. The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount Elbert has remained the highest peak in Colorado. The first motorized ascent of Elbert occurred in 1949, when a Jeep was driven to the summit, apparently to judge suitability for skiing development. The summit of Mount Elbert is an alpine environment, featuring plants such as Phacelia sericea (sky-pilot), Hymenoxys grandiflora (old-man-of-the-mountain), and Geum rossii (alpine avens). Also noted are Carex atrata var. pullata, Salix desertorum, Platanthera hyperborea, Thalictrum fendleri, Aquilegia canadensis, Chenopodium album, Gentiana detonsa var. hallii, and Bigelovia parryi. Below treeline the mountain is heavily forested, with the lower slopes covered with a mixture of lodgepole pine, spruce, aspen, and fir. Some of the fauna reported on the climb to the summit include black bears, marmots, mule deer, pikas, and pocket gophers; there are also many species of birds. Elk, grouse, turkey, and bighorn sheep are present in the area during the summer. Grizzly bears are extirpated.", "text1": "The naming of Mount Elbert was a significant event in the region's history, as it marked the beginning of a new era of exploration and development in the Rocky Mountains.

Despite its remote location, Mount Elbert was also a significant landmark for the growing city of Denver, which lay several miles to the east. The mountain's summit could be seen from the city on clear days, serving as a symbol of the vast wilderness that lay just beyond the reach of civilization.\n\nAs the years passed, Mount Elbert continued to attract visitors and adventurers from all over the world.

{"prefix": "On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas. The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA).", "gold": "The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions. In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident. A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The idea of \"no independence before majority rule\" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia's government was dominated by the country's white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally. Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia. Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism\u2013Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the \"Second Chimurenga\" against the Rhodesian government and security forces. The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour. The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU. Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a d\u00e9tente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup. Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976.", "text1": "These cross-border raids sparked a wave of protests and international condemnation, with the African National Congress (ANC) and other anti-apartheid groups calling for the immediate withdrawal of Rhodesian forces from neighboring countries. The Soviet Union and its allies, meanwhile, seized upon the crisis to further fuel the conflict, providing military aid and support to ZIPRA and ZANLA.\n\nAs tensions escalated, the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZPRA), a guerrilla force allied with ZIPRA, launched a series of sabotage attacks against Rhodesian infrastructure, including bridges, roads, and communication lines. The Rhodesian Security Forces responded with increased brutality, carrying out mass arrests and detentions, and deploying special forces units to hunt down and eliminate suspected guerrilla fighters.\n\nDespite these efforts, the insurgency continued to gain momentum, with growing numbers of Zimbabwean nationalists fleeing to neighboring countries to join the fight. The conflict began to exact a devastating toll on the civilian population, with reports of widespread human rights abuses, forced relocations, and economic instability spreading throughout the region. As the year drew to a close, it became increasingly clear that the conflict was far from resolution, and that the fate of Rhodesia, and the future of southern Africa, hung precariously in the balance.", "text2": "The retaliatory strikes drew heavy criticism from international organizations, with the United Nations and African countries condemning the violence.

For others, far from our borders, it is an intellectual matter, not one which affects them deeply. Here is the tragedy!\" The talks between Smith and the ZAPU leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by Salisbury. Smith himself called Nkomo a \"monster\". Cilliers comments that the ending of the Smith\u2013Nkomo talks at this time was \"potentially the most serious result of the Viscount massacre\", as the talks had been progressing well before the incident. He surmises that an agreement between the two \"at this critical stage\" might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition. On 10 September, the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law, which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed. He declared Rhodesia's intent to \"liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism\", and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for \"any defensive strikes we might undertake\" against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front. William Irvine, the co-Minister of Transport, warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia \"w[ould] not let these innocents go unavenged\". Because ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia, many Rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country, but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around Chimoio in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during Operation Dingo, destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called \"New Chimoio\", slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals. In a combined airborne-ground assault called Operation Snoopy, the Rhodesian Air Force, Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978.

In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south.

Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and executive producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode. Paul A. Edwards served as the director, his first such credit for the series. In developing Fringe, the co-creators did not want to make the series too serialized, as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams' television series Alias. They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content, and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration. Kurztman explained, \"While we make sure that our episodes are self-contained \u2013 have a beginning, a middle, and an end \u2013 the character stories can be serialized. They don't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show.\" \"The Same Old Story\" was Fringes first regular episode, and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured. The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they \"drilled out the eyeball and sculpt[ed] it open and [went] through a series of molds.\" Stanley stated that \"it's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me, even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out.\" The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a \"photon gun\"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons. VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye's last vision, they used \"a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location,\" which they then used to \"take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab.\" \"The Same Old Story\" featured guest appearances by actors Derek Cecil as Christopher Penrose and Mark Blum as his father, Dr. Claus Penrose.", "text1": "Walter's eyes widened in surprise as he digested Olivia's revelation. \"Void of any details, you say?

This is Harry Potter\" after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield. Eight months later, following several auditions, Radcliffe was selected to play the part. Rowling endorsed the selection, saying: \"I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\" Radcliffe's parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two-film contract with shooting in the UK; Radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would act in more than two Harry Potter films. The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone took place in 2001. Radcliffe received a seven-figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was \"not that important\" to him; his parents chose to invest the money for him. The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews, and critics took notice of Radcliffe: \"Radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader's imagination. It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing,\" wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle.

The University has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity.", "gold": "The University of Colorado's Research Misconduct Committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether Churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to \"add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship\". The committee concluded that the allegation was not \"appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research misconduct\". In a 2005 interview in The Rocky Mountain News, Churchill said, \"I have never been confirmed as having one-quarter blood, and never said I was. And even if [the critics] are absolutely right, what does that have to do with this issue? I have never claimed to be goddamned Sitting Bull.\" The longtime indigenous activist Russell Means said in February of that year, \"So I want, from this day forward, every media person nationally, internationally and locally to know that we have ascertained that Ward Churchill is a full-blooded Indian leader.\" Churchill has responded to requests for verification of his asserted Indian heritage in various ways, including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native American tribes establish their membership requirements. Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency. For decades in his writings, Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose. He says, Set the blood quantum at one-quarter, hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians, let intermarriage proceed as it [has] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence. Churchill's assertions have been raised as one of the several research-misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 (see below). He has been accused of using his interpretation of the Dawes Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member. Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture, and what he describes as the genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the Americas by European-American settlers and the ongoing repression of native peoples. According to the University of Colorado investigation, \"His academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and reinterpretation, drawing upon studies by other scholars, not monographs describing new research based on primary sources.\"", "text1": "However, supporters of Churchill's Native American heritage, including many faculty and students at the University of Colorado, argue that his claim of ancestry is a matter of personal identity and should be respected, even if it cannot be definitively proven. They point out that many Native Americans have similar experiences of being told they are not \"really\" Native American because they do not have official documentation of their heritage. They also argue that Churchill's connection to his Native American ancestry has been a driving force behind his advocacy work for Native American rights and social justice.\n\nThe university's decision to not hire on the basis of ethnicity has also been questioned by some, who argue that the institution's emphasis on diversity and inclusion is being undermined by its inability to recognize Churchill's Native American heritage. Critics of the university's stance argue that failing to acknowledge Churchill's ancestry sends a message that his experiences and perspectives are not valued or validated.\n\nThe debate surrounding Churchill's Native American ancestry has sparked a wider conversation about the complexities of identity, representation, and authenticity. As the controversy continues to unfold, many are left wondering whether it is possible for someone to claim a Native American identity without being able to provide concrete proof of their ancestry. Ultimately, the question remains: what does it mean to be Native American, and who gets to decide?", "text2": "The university's statement has been met with skepticism from some Native American leaders and scholars, who argue that the lack of concrete evidence supporting Churchill's claim has led to the dismissal of concerns raised by his critics. They point to the significant harm caused by cultural appropriation and erasure of Native American experiences, and worry that Churchill's unsubstantiated claims will perpetuate these injustices.\n\n\"The lack of accountability from Churchill and his supporters undermines the credibility and validity of the experiences and struggles faced by Native American peoples,\" said Ana Medina, a historian of Native American studies at a nearby university. \"We cannot allow individuals to claim affiliation and authority on the basis of hearsay or speculation without the backing of verifiable records and testimonial evidence.\"\n\nThe university's statement has also sparked criticism from some of the faculty members, who argue that the lack of hiring based on ethnicity is not a guarantee against the perpetuation of systemic racial and ethnic biases. They point to the significant underrepresentation of Native American faculty members at the university and the lack of programs aimed at addressing the specific needs and concerns of Native American students.\n\n\"The university's claim may be well-intentioned, but it ignores the structural barriers that Native American students and faculty face,\" said Emily Marie, a Native American student at the university. \"We deserve better than lip service and hollow promises. We demand concrete actions that address our concerns and priorities.\"\n\nThe debate surrounding Churchill's claim has further heightened tensions between Native American and mainstream communities, with some individuals calling for greater transparency and accountability from institutions of higher learning.

Ana Medina, a historian of Native American studies at a nearby university, expressed that Churchill's lack of accountability and support weakens the credibility and validity of Native American peoples' experiences and struggles.

The planet orbits the solar analog star, Upsilon Andromedae A, approximately every five days.", "gold": "Discovered in June 1996 by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler, it was one of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered. It is also one of the first non-resolved planets to be detected directly. Upsilon Andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Saffar for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Vega Astronomy Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al-Saffar of Muslim Spain. Upsilon Andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of Upsilon Andromedae's spectrum. The planet's existence was announced in January 1997, together with 55 Cancri b and the planet orbiting Tau Bo\u00f6tis. Like 51 Pegasi b, the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star, Upsilon Andromedae b orbits very close to its star, closer than Mercury does to our Sun. The planet takes 4.617 days to complete an orbit, with a semimajor axis of 0.0595 AU. A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found. The true mass may be much greater depending on the inclination of the orbit. A mass of and an inclination of 24\u00b0 were later found using high-resolution spectroscopy. Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface.", "text1": "...making it one of the hottest known exoplanets, with surface temperatures reaching as high as 2,200\u00b0F (1,200\u00b0C). Despite these extreme conditions, Saffar is a gas giant, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a mass roughly 1.3 times that of Jupiter. Its proximity to its host star means it is likely to be tidally locked, with one side perpetually scorching and the other in perpetual darkness.\n\nAstronomers are intrigued by the unique environment on Saffar, which could potentially harbor exotic forms of life adapted to the extreme heat and radiation. The discovery of Saffar has also sparked new research into the formation and evolution of planetary systems around solar-like stars, as well as the potential for life to thrive in the most inhospitable of environments.\n\nIn 2023, a team of scientists announced the detection of a faint, infrared glow emanating from Saffar's atmosphere, which could be indicative of atmospheric escape or the presence of an unknown atmospheric constituent. Further studies are planned to investigate this intriguing finding and shed light on the mysteries of this distant, scorching world.", "text2": "The discovery of Upsilon Andromedae b was announced in 1999 by a team of astronomers using the Keck Telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. Initially, the team thought they had detected two planets, but subsequent observations revealed only one massive gas giant, with a mass of at least 0.69 times the mass of Jupiter. The planet's surface temperature is estimated to be around 2,500 Kelvin (2,227\u00b0C or 4,041\u00b0F), which is much hotter than Earth's surface temperature of about 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).\n\nDue to the extremely close proximity of Upsilon Andromedae b to its host star, it is thought to be tidally locked, meaning that one side of the planet always faces the star while the other side perpetually faces away. The intense heat from the star would create extreme conditions on the day side, making it inhospitable to life as we know it. The night side, on the other hand, is likely to be freezing cold, making it equally unsuitable for any potential biospheres.\n\nUpsilon Andromedae b's proximity to its host star has led scientists to speculate about the possible formation mechanisms of the system. One theory suggests that the massive gas giant formed in the outer reaches of the system, then migrated closer to the host star due to gravitational interactions with the inner planets. Further study of Upsilon Andromedae b's orbit and mass can provide valuable insights into the complex processes involved in the formation and evolution of exoplanet systems.\n\nResearchers continue to monitor Upsilon Andromedae b's orbit, searching for subtle variations that might indicate the presence of additional planets in the system. The discovery of Upsilon Andromedae b has significant implications for our understanding of the formation and potential habitability of exoplanet systems, inspiring new avenues of research and exploration in the field of exoplanetary science.", "text3": "In 1999, astronomers using the Keck Telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii announced the discovery of Upsilon Andromedae b.

Upsilon Andromedae b is believed to be tidally locked due to its close proximity to its host star, resulting in one side always facing the star and the other side always facing away. The extreme heat generated by the star would make the day side of the planet unsuitable for life as we understand it. Conversely, the dark side is expected to be extremely cold, rendering it inhospitable for any potential life forms. Scientists are considering the potential ways in which the system containing Upsilon Andromedae b may have formed due to its close distance to its host star. One hypothesis proposes that the large gas giant initially developed in the outer regions of the system before moving closer to the host star as a result of gravitational interactions with the inner planets. Studying the orbit and mass of Upsilon Andromedae b can offer important information about how exoplanet systems form and change over time. Scientists are still observing the path of Upsilon Andromedae b, looking for small changes that could suggest the existence of more planets in the system.

This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in Trenton to present-day I-295 in Ewing Township. Construction of this portion of the John Fitch Parkway took up much of Trenton\u2019s available waterfront along the Delaware River. The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of Trenton and in Ewing Township became Route 175. Between 1990 and 1995, the Route 29 freeway was built between the I-195/I-295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township. A two-lane street, Lamberton Road, connected the two freeway sections. Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in Trenton. Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the Morrisville\u2013Trenton Railroad Bridge. The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River. The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel. The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2, 2002. A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002. By the 2000s, the state gave the part of Route 29 (South Main Street) between Route 165 and Route 179 in Lambertville to the city, and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179. Prior to this, South Main Street had been turned one-way southbound. Route 165, which is only signed on overhead street signs, still exists, though it is fully concurrent with Route 29. A part of Route 29 was designated in 1959 as the John Fitch Parkway, honoring inventor John Fitch, \"beginning with the bridge crossing over the Assunpink Creek at the conjunction of Factory Street with John Fitch Way in the city of Trenton and including the traffic circle surrounding the War Memorial building and the freeway extending in a westerly direction therefrom, along the bank of the Delaware river, to the city line of the city of Trenton...\" During the 1960s the War Memorial and the surrounding circle were bypassed by a realignment of Route 29 closer to the Delaware River.", "text1": "Despite the abandonment of the parkway plan, the need for a improved transportation corridor along the Route 29 route persisted. In the 1950s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation revisited the idea of a limited-access highway, this time proposing a freeway-style route that would bypass the busy and congested Route 29. The new route, dubbed the \"Delaware River Expressway,\" was designed to reduce traffic congestion and improve safety along the corridor.\n\nAfter years of planning and environmental impact studies, construction on the Delaware River Expressway finally began in the late 1960s. The new highway, designated as Interstate 95, was designed to stretch from the Pennsylvania border to the Garden State Parkway, with a partial cloverleaf interchange connecting it to Route 29 near Lambertville.\n\nWhen I-95 was completed in the early 1970s, it largely replaced the original Route 29, relegating the former highway to secondary status. The section of former Route 29 between Route 29A and Route S29, previously designated as Route 165, was eventually re-designated as County Route 519, serving local traffic and businesses. Today, the remnants of the original Route 29 serve as a nostalgic reminder of the region's transportation history, a testament to the ever-evolving nature of infrastructure development in New Jersey.", "text2": "In the decades that followed, various concepts and proposals for a freeway along Route 29 were floated, but none came to fruition until the mid-20th century, when highway construction boomed in the United States. In 1953, the New Jersey Department of Highways launched a comprehensive study to improve the transportation infrastructure of the region, including a proposed limited-access route along Route 29.\n\nThe study envisioned a freeway that would parallel Route 29, but be situated several miles west, away from urban centers and historic districts. The new route, dubbed \"Route X\" at the time, would provide a faster and more efficient way for commuters and truckers to travel between Trenton and Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\n\nOver the next decade, the New Jersey Department of Highways continued to refine its plans for Route X, addressing concerns raised by local residents and environmentalists about the potential impact of the freeway on the region's scenic landscape. Despite these challenges, the project moved forward, and in the late 1960s, the necessary funding and approvals were in place to begin construction.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the first sections of the freeway began to take shape, with multiple lanes and interchanges popping up along the Route 29 corridor. The new route was renamed Route 159 as part of the numbering system's reorganization in the late 1980s, and as the years went by, it became a crucial link in the regional highway network.\n\nToday, Route 159 remains an important transportation artery, serving as a vital connection between the Trenton area and Philadelphia, and providing access to key employment hubs, shopping districts, and natural areas. Despite its role in the region's transportation infrastructure, the route remains largely overlooked, a testament to the complex and sometimes contentious history of highway development in the United States.", "text3": "Different ideas and plans for a highway on Route 29 were suggested over the years, but it wasn't until the mid-20th century that construction actually began due to the highway boom in the United States. In 1953, the New Jersey Department of Highways initiated a thorough examination to enhance the area's transportation infrastructure, which included a suggested limited-access route on Route 29. The study proposed a highway that would run alongside Route 29, but be located a few miles to the west, away from cities and historic areas. Route X was intended to offer a quicker and more effective route for commuters and truck drivers traveling between Trenton and Bucks County, Pennsylvania. In the following years, the New Jersey Department of Highways made adjustments to their plans for Route X in response to feedback from residents and environmentalists concerned about the freeway's impact on the area's natural beauty. Despite facing obstacles, the project progressed and by the late 1960s, construction was ready to commence with the required funding and approvals secured. In the mid-1970s, the initial segments of the highway started to form, featuring various lanes and interchanges along Route 29. Route 159 was rebranded as part of a numbering system overhaul in the late 1980s and eventually became an important connection in the local highway system. Route 159 continues to be a crucial link between Trenton and Philadelphia, offering access to employment centers, shopping areas, and natural spaces.

One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan. The Burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. (The chronicles say that the Burmese army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.) The Burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283. The defeat at Ngasaunggyan broke the back of Burmese defenses. The Burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort in line, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. The Mongol sources say that the Burmese lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin. The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270 km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports (Prome, Dala and Bassein), the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome. Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of Pegu revolted that same year.

The flight took off from Kariba Airport on schedule soon after 17:00 Central Africa Time. Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain John Hood, a native of Bulawayo who had gained his commercial pilot licence in 1966. He had flown Viscounts for Air Rhodesia since 1968, and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force on a voluntary basis. His first officer, Garth Beaumont, was 31 years old, and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life, having immigrated as a child from South Africa. The two air stewardesses were Dulcie Esterhuizen, 21 years old and from Bulawayo, and 23-year-old Louise Pearson, from Salisbury. A group of ZIPRA guerrillas, armed with a Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly. At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash. \"We're going in,\" he radioed. Telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of Karoi, intending to belly land the craft. The landing was relatively stable until the Hunyani hit a ditch, cartwheeled and exploded. The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin ablaze.

They were a mixed bag, ranging from young couples on their honeymoon to families on vacation and lone travelers seeking adventure. Some were reading books or playing cards, while others were chatting with their fellow travelers or sipping cocktails at the bar.\n\nIn the midst of this relaxed atmosphere, a lone figure caught the eye of the pilot, Captain Thompson. He was standing at the rear of the lounge, dressed in a crumpled suit and looking out of place among the tourists. Thompson recognized the man as a British journalist, known for his fearless reporting from the conflict zones of Africa. What was he doing on a pleasure cruise, Thompson wondered? And was it mere coincidence that he was heading in the same direction as the rebels on the northern side of the Zambezi?", "text2": "As the Hunyani chugged along the Zambezi River, the passengers on deck couldn't help but notice the thick haze of smoke rising from the north bank.

His mind was elsewhere, though. His younger sister, a nurse, had recently joined the medical corps and was stationed at a rural hospital in the north. The news from the front had been grim lately, and Captain Jameson couldn't shake the feeling that his sister was in greater danger with every passing day.\n\nHe looked up to see a nervous steward, Harris, entering his cabin with a cup of coffee. \"Captain, we've received word that the guerrillas are blocking the road to Salisbury. We may need to take an alternate route back to Victoria Falls,\" Harris said, eyeing the Captain's expression.\n\nCaptain Jameson sipped his coffee, his eyes fixed on the river. \"Very well,\" he said, his voice calm. \"Inform the passengers, and prepare the crew for any contingency we might need to take.\" The tension on the Hunyani had just ratcheted up a notch.", "text3": "While cruising down the Zambezi River, the passengers on the Hunyani observed a dense smoke cloud coming from the northern shore.

{"prefix": "The sound test was scrapped for time reasons and Naka used the freed up memory to add the \"Se-ga!\" chant used in TV commercials as a startup sound.", "gold": "Naka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code. Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty. Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier. The team read Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they could avoid their mistakes. Sega director Fujio Minegishi had connections to the music industry, and suggested his friend Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama write the Sonic score. However, Sonic Team did not think Kayama's music would fit, and so commissioned Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True. Nakamura said he was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack, as he had just started with Dreams Come True, but accepted as he was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo. Nakamura said the hardest part of creating the soundtrack was the number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it \"impossible\". He wrote the soundtrack concurrently with the Dreams Come True album Million Kisses.", "text1": "With the addition of the iconic \"Se-ga!\" chant, the game's startup sequence took on a new level of energy and excitement. According to Naka, the idea was to create a sense of anticipation and hype, setting the tone for the player's experience. The chant, which was originally used in TV commercials to promote the game, was meant to be a short-lived experiment, but it ended up becoming an integral part of the game's identity.\n\nAs development progressed, the \"Se-ga!\" chant became a source of inspiration for the team. They began to incorporate it into various aspects of the game, from the sound effects to the music. The chant's infectious energy seemed to seep into every corner of the game, making it feel more dynamic and engaging.\n\nHowever, the \"Se-ga!\" chant wasn't the only change that came about as a result of scrapping the sound test. With the freed up memory, Naka and his team were able to implement a new feature that would revolutionize the way players controlled Sonic: the spin dash.\n\nInitially, the spin dash was meant to be a temporary solution to a problem the team was having with Sonic's movement. However, as they experimented with the mechanic, they discovered it added a new layer of depth and strategy to the gameplay. The spin dash allowed players to maintain their speed and momentum while navigating tight spaces, making it a crucial tool for navigating the game's fast-paced levels.\n\nThe spin dash's inclusion marked a significant shift in Sonic's gameplay, moving away from the more linear, platforming-focused approach of the first game. Instead, Sonic's speed and agility became even more pronounced, making the game feel faster-paced and more intense. The spin dash also introduced new challenges and opportunities for players to exploit, further emphasizing the importance of exploration and experimentation.\n\nAs the game neared completion, Naka and his team knew they had created something special. The combination of the \"Se-ga!\" chant, the spin dash, and the game's already impressive graphics and music made Sonic the Hedgehog 2 a standout title in the burgeoning platformer genre. Little did they know, however, that this game would go on to become one of the most beloved and influential games of all time, setting the stage for a franchise that would continue to thrill gamers for decades to come.", "text2": "The addition of the \"Se-ga!\" chant was a surprise to the team, and many were hesitant at first, worried that it would take away from the classic Sonic the Hedgehog feel they had established. However, Naka was convinced it would add a unique element to the game's identity, and convinced the team to give it a shot. During internal playtesting sessions, the team was initially split on the effectiveness of the chant, with some loving the burst of energy it added to the start of the game, while others found it grating and distracting.\n\nBut, as the games' development wore on, the team started to see a strange trend emerge: the players who initially complained about the chant were the same ones who started to show more enthusiasm and excitement when playing the game. The weird thing was, the team couldn't put their finger on why. Was it the sheer novelty of the chant that was finally growing on them? Or was there something more to it? Whatever the reason, the team was surprised when they saw that the internal playtesting sessions were yielding some of the best results yet, with players displaying a renewed sense of excitement and energy as they sprinted through Green Hill Zone.\n\nBy the time Sega officially released Sonic the Hedgehog to the public, the team was ecstatic to see that the same sentiment was shared by players worldwide. The startup sound, once a source of disagreement, had turned out to be one of the games' defining characteristics.

Opinions within the team were divided on the \"Se-ga!\" chant during playtesting, with some enjoying the energy it brought and others finding it annoying. However, as development progressed, the team noticed a peculiar pattern where those who initially criticized the chant ended up becoming more enthusiastic and excited while playing the game. The team couldn't figure out the reason behind it. Were they starting to enjoy the chant simply because it was something new and different? Was there a deeper reason for this change in attitude? The team was shocked to see that the internal playtesting sessions were producing excellent results, with players showing increased excitement and energy while playing through Green Hill Zone. Upon the official release of Sonic the Hedgehog by Sega, the team was thrilled to find that players worldwide shared their excitement.

She was only hit by a single 12-inch shell that wounded two crewmen. Both guns in her aft 12-inch gun turret, however, were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels. In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships and although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells, which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact. The ship made the critical hits of the battle, however, when two of her 12-inch shells struck the bridge of Tsesarevich, killing the Russian squadron commander, Vice Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, two of his staff officers and the ship's quartermaster. The ship's wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the Russian ships into total confusion. The second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky, eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to Port Arthur. Slightly more than two months later, on 26 October, Asahi struck a mine off Port Arthur while on blockade duty. Severely damaged, she was under repair at Sasebo Naval Arsenal from November 1904 to April 1905. Russian naval forces in the Far East had been destroyed or neutralized by this time and the Russians were forced to transfer ships from the Baltic Fleet that did not arrive until May. At the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, Asahi again followed the battleship into combat, this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons. Mikasa opened fire at the battleship , the Russian flagship, at 14:10, and was joined by Asahi and the armoured cruiser shortly afterwards. Within an hour the Japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship, badly wounded the fleet commander, Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, knocked out her rear 12-inch gun turret, and jammed Knyaz Suvorovs steering so that she fell out of formation.", "text1": "As the Japanese Navy regrouped and reorganized, Admiral T\u014dg\u014d's aggressive tactics continued to pay dividends.

The Japanese Navy, meanwhile, continued to refine its tactics and training, and its pilots and sailors became increasingly confident and effective.\n\nIn September, T\u014dg\u014d's flagship, the battleship Mikasa, led a fleet of 38 warships in a daring attack on the Russian naval base at Tsushima Strait. The Russians, led by Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, put up a fierce resistance, but were ultimately forced to retreat in disarray. The Japanese claimed victory, having sunk six Russian battleships, five cruisers, and numerous smaller vessels, and capturing over 3,000 Russian sailors.\n\nThe Tsushima Strait battle marked a decisive turning point in the war, as the Russian Baltic Fleet was effectively eliminated as a naval force.

German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater, in turn, accused Caberta of stoking a \"hate campaign\" in Germany that had \"ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists\" and maintained that Scientologists had not \"exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States.\" Mark Rathbun, a (former) top Church of Scientology official, said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case, \"there would have been nothing improper if it had.\" In 2003, Joachim G\u00fcntner, writing in the Swiss Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung, noted that Gerhard Besier, a German Christian theologian, director of the Hannah Arendt Institute for Research into Totalitarianism in Dresden and recipient of an honorary doctorate from Lund University, Sweden, for his championing of religious freedom, had been pressured to forego publication of his scientific study of Scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the German media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards Scientology. G\u00fcntner concluded that \"alarmism\" had \"triumphed\" over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in Germany's ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter. The U.S. Department of State's 2012 report on religious freedom in Germany, published in 2013, stated that \"The status of the Church of Scientology remains in limbo. The Constitutional Court and various courts at the state level have not explicitly ruled that Scientology is a religion. Government agencies at the federal and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against Scientology as a group and against its members. Four of the major political parties (the Christian Democratic Union, Christian Social Union, Social Democratic Party, and Free Democratic Party) ban Scientologists from party membership.", "text1": "The investigation revealed that the Scientologist, a young woman named Sylvia, had been living in Germany for several years and had been experiencing severe mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. Despite her fragile mental state, the German authorities had subjected her to a grueling and invasive investigation, including a 12-hour interrogation and a physical examination at a police station.\n\nThe magazine's findings sparked widespread outrage and criticism of the German government's handling of the case. Human rights groups and religious organizations condemned the treatment of Sylvia as unacceptable and reminiscent of the discrimination and persecution faced by Jews during the Holocaust. The German government was accused of perpetuating a culture of intolerance and discrimination, particularly towards minority religious groups.\n\nIn response to the backlash, the German government launched an internal investigation into the treatment of Sylvia and other Scientologists. While the investigation ultimately cleared the authorities of any wrongdoing, it did acknowledge that the handling of the case had been \"unfortunate\" and that more sensitivity was needed when dealing with members of minority religions.\n\nThe incident highlighted the ongoing tensions between Germany and the Church of Scientology, which has been the subject of controversy and criticism in Germany for decades. The Church has been accused of being a cult, and its beliefs and practices have been widely criticized as being harmful and manipulative. The incident also raised questions about the German government's commitment to protecting the rights of minority religious groups and promoting religious tolerance and understanding.", "text2": "The investigation found that the Scientologists had not been subjected to systematic persecution or genocide, and that their experiences in Germany were largely due to their controversial beliefs and practices, rather than their religious beliefs. The magazine also reported that the Scientologists had not been stripped of their rights, properties, or lives, and that many had continued to practice their religion and build a community in Germany.\n\nMeanwhile, the Church of Scientology issued its own statement, accusing the government and media of anti-Scientology discrimination and bias. The Church claimed that the investigation had only further proved its allegations of persecution and harassment, and that the government was trying to silence and discredit the Church.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the investigation sparked heated debates among scholars, experts, and ordinary people, with some arguing that the comparison to the Nazi era was misplaced and that the Scientologists had not been subjected to the same kind of systematic violence and discrimination. Others countered that the Church's controversial teachings and practices, such as its claims to be the only true spiritual guidance for humanity and its controversial auditing techniques, were comparable to the discriminatory ideology of the Nazi regime.\n\nAs the debate continued to rage on, many questioned the validity and relevance of the comparison, and wondered whether the Church of Scientology was using it as a propaganda tool to garner sympathy and support from believers around the world.", "text3": "The investigation concluded that the Scientologists in Germany faced challenges primarily because of their controversial beliefs and practices, rather than systematic persecution or genocide.

{"prefix": "Like other crustaceans, lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow, in a process called ecdysis (molting). This may occur several times a year for young lobsters, but decreases to once every 1\u20132 years for larger animals.", "gold": "The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large, asymmetrical pair of feet. The larger one is the \"crusher\", and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the \"cutter\", which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. Usually, the left claw is the crusher, and the right is the cutter. The exoskeleton is generally blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment. The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap. The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics: The rostrum of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in H. gammarus. The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red-tipped, while those of H. gammarus are white or white-tipped. The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red, while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red. Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size. Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female, whose shell is therefore soft, and a hard-shelled male. The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months, depending on the temperature, attached to her pleopods. Females carrying eggs are said to be \"berried\" and can be found throughout the year. The eggs hatch at night, and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15\u201335 days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a benthic lifestyle.", "text1": "As they outgrow their exoskeleton, lobsters will often retreat to a sheltered area, such as a crevice or a burrow, to molt. During this time, they are vulnerable to predators and must be careful to avoid detection. After molting, the lobster will emerge from its hiding spot and begin to harden its new exoskeleton, a process that can take several hours. This is a critical period for the lobster, as it is when it is most susceptible to disease and injury.\n\nAfter hardening, the lobster will begin to re-familiarize itself with its surroundings and search for food. Young lobsters, in particular, will often feed voraciously during this time to build up their energy reserves and prepare for their next molt. In the wild, lobsters can live for up to 100 years, although the average lifespan is typically much shorter due to predation, disease, and other environmental factors.\n\nDespite their impressive lifespan, lobsters are able to molt multiple times throughout their lives, allowing them to continue growing and adapting to their environment. This remarkable ability to shed and regrow their exoskeleton has allowed lobsters to thrive in their underwater habitats for millions of years.", "text2": "During this process, lobsters experience a brief vulnerability, making themselves more susceptible to predators and environmental stressors. As a result, ecdysis can be a crucial survival stage for lobsters, with a high risk of mortality if the process is not executed correctly.\n\nFortunately, lobsters have evolved several adaptations to ensure their successful molting. For instance, before shedding their shell, lobsters stop eating and their digestive system slows down to conserve energy and water. They may also change their behavior, hiding in crevices or underwater structures to reduce their exposure to predators.\n\nAfter molting, lobsters enter a state of dormancy, called apodism, during which their eyes, mouthparts, and antennae are retracted into their shell for protection. They may remain in this vulnerable position for up to several days before re-emerging and resuming their normal activity, during which time their new shell is still soft and pliable.\n\nThroughout this critical period, lobsters also rely on the quality of their molted shell to protect themselves. The new shell, while still soft, is thinner and more prone to damage than their previous shell, making it essential for them to find sheltered areas to grow and harden. As the new shell sets and hardens, the lobsters' bodies begin to adapt, allowing them to grow and mature further before entering another phase of their life cycle.", "text3": "Lobsters become briefly vulnerable during this process, increasing their risk of being targeted by predators and affected by environmental stressors. If lobsters do not molt correctly, they face a high risk of dying, making ecdysis a critical stage for their survival. Thankfully, lobsters have developed various adaptations to guarantee a successful molting process. Prior to shedding their shell, lobsters go without food and their digestive system slows down in order to save energy and water. They might alter their behavior by seeking shelter in crevices or underwater structures to minimize their risk of being targeted by predators. Following molting, lobsters go into a dormant state known as apodism, where their eyes, mouthparts, and antennae are withdrawn into their shell as a protective measure. After molting, lobsters may stay vulnerable for several days while their new shell is still soft before returning to their usual activities. During this crucial time, lobsters depend on the strength of their newly molted shell for protection. It is crucial for lobsters to seek sheltered areas to allow their new, softer shell to grow and harden, as it is more susceptible to damage compared to their old shell.

It was only the necessary ending to the beginning. True humor does not emanate from cognac.\" The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, \"This is the old story of too many cooks, and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way. The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation. ... A weak point in the story is the fact that the pie is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power. Two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing.

Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming, equally-footed couplets (pianti, ) used in the Imperial examinations, but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court.", "text1": "Despite the uncertainty surrounding his early career, Hu's fate became shrouded in mystery after Beijing's fall to the Manchu rebellion. Some accounts suggest that he was forced to flee the city, leaving behind his family and possessions, while others claim that he was captured by the enemy and never heard from again. The Hanlin Academy, once a symbol of his academic and professional aspirations, was now under the control of the invading forces.\n\nYears went by, and the news of Hu's disappearance was gradually forgotten, overshadowed by the turmoil and upheaval that followed the rebellion. It wasn't until decades later, when Wen, a distant relative of Hu's, began compiling his biography, that the story of his life was revived. Wen's account, published in 1830, provided a detailed and vivid portrayal of Hu's life, including his alleged promotion to the Ministry of Personnel and his admittance to the Hanlin Academy.\n\nHowever, the veracity of Wen's account has been called into question by many scholars, who point out the lack of contemporary evidence to support these claims. Some have even speculated that Wen, driven by a desire to elevate his own family's reputation, fabricated the entire narrative. As a result, Hu's life remains shrouded in mystery, leaving historians to continue their search for the truth about this enigmatic figure from China's troubled past.", "text2": "The question of whether Hu Yinglin's early career events were fabricated or not had plagued scholars for centuries.

The contents of the scroll blew apart the theory of fabricated events, painting a vivid picture of Hu's struggles to secure his promotion and his tumultuous ride into the midst of the rebellion's devastation.\n\nThe scroll's findings sent shockwaves through the academic community, with many scholars reevaluating their understanding of Hu's life and times.

The force of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill 123. Under Marine artillery fire, Kokusho reassembled his men and continued his attack. Without pausing to try to \"roll-up\" the other nearby Marine units, whose flanks were now unprotected, Kokusho's unit surged forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the Lunga River, heading for the airfield.

After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders, and not prepared to risk a frontal attack, the Boers eventually retired. The Siege of Elands River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war, with the post finally relieved on 16 August. In response the British adopted counter-insurgency tactics, including a scorched earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops, the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children, and a system of blockhouses and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications. Such measures required considerable expenditure, and caused much bitterness towards the British, however they soon yielded results.

Richmond had suffered a 64-race winless streak that was finally broken at the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500 at Pocono in June 1986. After two straight second-place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \"push\", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end.

At one point during the battle, the flag Moultrie had designed and raised over the fort was shot down.", "gold": "Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again, holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided. He was credited by Moultrie with reviving the troops' spirits, and later given commendations for bravery. A painting of this event (pictured above) depicts Jasper's actions. Counting casualties, Parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard Bristol, which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to the hull, yards, and rigging. Experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded. Active and Solebay reported 15 casualties each. The Americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded. The following morning, the British, unable to drag the grounded Acteon off the sandbar, set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Patriots in small boats sailed out to the burning ships, and fired some of their cannons at the British ships, took what stores and loot they could, and retreated shortly before the ship's powder magazine exploded. The British did not attempt to take the fort again. Within days of the battle, Charlestonians learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. The British troops were reembarked on their transports, and on July 21 the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in its campaign against New York City. To add insult to injury, one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by Patriot forces. The British did not return to Charleston until 1780, when General Clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army. Until the South again became a focus of the war in late 1778, its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort. Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle, each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition's failures. Although Clinton was not blamed by the government, popular opinion held him responsible, and Parker was lauded for his personal bravery. Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort Moultrie shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William Moultrie for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston.", "text1": "As the fleet withdrew, the exhausted defenders of Fort Moultrie took stock of the damage and the loss of their beloved flag.

Captain Moultrie, still defiant, refused to yield, citing the flag that had been shot down and the bravery of his men. The British officers, taken aback by the American commander's resolve, began to debate among themselves the wisdom of continuing the siege.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Charleston, Colonel William Thomson, the commander of the provincial forces, was racing against time to organize a relief force to aid Fort Moultrie. News of the British attack had spread quickly through the city, and citizens were rallying to the cause, donating supplies and offering their services to the colonial militia. Thomson's men, a motley crew of regulars and volunteers, set out at dawn, determined to reinforce the fort and drive the British back.", "text2": "As the British fleet retreated, the exhausted and weary defenders of Sullivan's Island gathered what was left of their makeshift fort, surveying the devastation.

{"prefix": "These behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars.", "gold": "Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers\u2014known colloquially as Diggers\u2014have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities. From 1788 until 1870 the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces. Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service, known as the New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804. Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion, a coup mounted by its officers in 1808. As a result, in January 1810 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By 1870, 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units. Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack, no actual threat ever materialised. The British Army was instead used in policing, guarding convicts at penal institutions, combating bushranging, putting down convict rebellions\u2014as occurred at Bathurst in 1830\u2014and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement. Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 on the Victorian goldfields. Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan. During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by units detached by the Royal Navy's Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, based in Sydney. However, in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a commodore, marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia. The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913, when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy; the Royal Navy's depots, dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people.", "text1": "This conundrum has led to a dichotomy in Australia's strategic approach, where it must navigate the need to maintain a robust national security posture while also avoiding entanglement in the complex and often contentious geopolitics of the Asia-Pacific. On the one hand, Australia's geographical proximity to the Asia-Pacific's major powers and its own economic interests in the region necessitate a strong diplomatic and military presence. On the other hand, its physical removal from the global power centers means that it must be cautious not to overcommit itself, lest it become mired in conflicts that are not inherently its own.\n\nAs a result, Australian foreign policy has oscillated between a \"fortress Australia\" approach, where it focuses on building strong ties with neighboring nations and maintaining a robust defense posture, and a more proactive engagement with the broader Asia-Pacific, where it seeks to shape regional dynamics and promote its own interests. This ambivalence is reflected in the country's ongoing debate over its role in the region, with some arguing that Australia should prioritize its traditional alliance with the United States and others advocating for a more independent and autonomous foreign policy.", "text2": "This has led Australia to develop a unique set of diplomatic and strategic relationships to mitigate these threats. On the one hand, it has fostered close ties with its neighboring countries in Southeast Asia, such as Singapore and Indonesia, in an effort to promote stability and counterbalance the influence of potential regional threats. On the other hand, it has also cultivated relationships with traditional allies, such as the United States, United Kingdom, and New Zealand, in an effort to pool its military and intelligence resources with others to ensure its security.\n\nAustralia's middle power status also lends itself to mediatory roles, where it can use its diplomatic influence and reputation to facilitate conflict resolution and peacekeeping efforts. For instance, it has been involved in the stabilization of Timor-Leste and Solomon Islands, and has played a key role in the Australian-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.", "text3": "Australia has formed special diplomatic and strategic relationships to address these threats.

{"prefix": "There appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by AD 317, when Lady Unen Bahlam conducted a katun-ending ceremony, apparently as queen of the city. As early as 200 AD Teotihuacan had embassies in Tikal.", "gold": "The fourteenth king of Tikal was Chak Tok Ich'aak (Great Jaguar Paw). Chak Tok Ich'aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis. Little is known about Chak Tok Ich'aak except that he was killed on 14 January 378 AD. On the same day, Siyah K\u2019ak' (Fire Is Born) arrived from the west, having passed through El Peru, a site to the west of Tikal, on 8 January. On Stela 31 he is named as \"Lord of the West\". Siyah K\u2019ak' was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non-Maya hieroglyph of a spearthrower combined with an owl, a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. Spearthrower Owl may even have been the ruler of Teotihuacan. These recorded events strongly suggest that Siyah K\u2019ak' led a Teotihuacan invasion that defeated the native Tikal king, who was captured and immediately executed. Siyah K'ak' appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at Tikal itself; roughly at the time of the conquest, a group of Teotihuacan natives were apparently residing near the Lost World complex. He also exerted control over other cities in the area, including Uaxactun, where he became king, but did not take the throne of Tikal for himself. Within a year, the son of Spearthrower Owl by the name of Yax Nuun Ayiin I (First Crocodile) had been installed as the fifteenth king of Tikal while he was still a boy, being enthroned on 13 September 379. He reigned for 47 years as king of Tikal, and remained a vassal of Siyah K'ak' for as long as the latter lived. It seems likely that Yax Nuun Ayiin I took a wife from the preexisting, defeated, Tikal dynasty and thus legitimized the right to rule of his son, Siyaj Chan K'awiil II.", "text1": "As the centuries passed, the relationships between Tikal and Teotihuacan continued to evolve. By the 4th century, Tikal had become a major power in its own right, with a complex system of alliances and rivalries with its neighboring city-states. Meanwhile, Teotihuacan's influence was waning, and the city was plagued by internal strife and external threats.\n\nDespite these challenges, Tikal's rulers continued to maintain a strong connection with their Teotihuacan counterparts. Archaeologists have discovered a number of Teotihuacan-style artifacts at Tikal, including ceramic vessels and architecture, indicating a continued cultural exchange between the two cities.\n\nOne of the most significant events in the history of Tikal's relationship with Teotihuacan occurred in the 6th century, when a Teotihuacan nobleman named Nuun Uhyp Zapayain arrived in Tikal as an exile. According to local legend, Zapayain was a member of the Teotihuacan royal family who had fled his home city to escape a coup.\n\nZapayain quickly became a powerful figure in Tikal, using his knowledge of Teotihuacan politics and culture to advise the city's rulers and help them navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries in the region. He also played a key role in the development of Tikal's own royal dynasty, helping to establish the city as a major power in its own right.\n\nAs the centuries passed, Tikal continued to thrive, with its rulers maintaining a strong connection to their Teotihuacan heritage. However, the city's fortunes would eventually decline, and it would be abandoned by the 9th century. Despite this, the legacy of Tikal's relationship with Teotihuacan would endure, and the city would remain an important cultural and historical site for centuries to come.", "text2": "The timing of Lady Unen Bahlam's ceremonial performance is intriguing, and suggests a power vacuum in the traditional male-dominated hierarchy of Tikal. Despite the uncertainty, the ceremony may have served to legitimize Lady Unen's claim to the throne, or alternatively, may have been an effort to secure her position as regent for a minor or disabled ruler. The fact that she is able to hold a katun-ending ceremony, a rare and significant event, indicates that she may have held a high degree of influence or authority.\n\nMeanwhile, the presence of Teotihuacan embassies at Tikal as early as 200 AD is a testament to the significant trade and diplomatic relations between the two powers. Teotihuacan, a vast and powerful city, had already established a network of trade routes and alliances with various states in Mesoamerica, and its involvement with Tikal likely marked a turning point in the city's rise to dominance. The exchange of ambassadors and goods would have helped cement ties between the two cities, and likely influenced the cultural and architectural development of Tikal.\n\nBy the late 3rd century AD, the influence of Teotihuacan at Tikal can be seen in the construction of grand, monumental architecture, such as the North Temple and Temple I, both of which feature Teotihuacan-style frescoes and architectural details. The integration of Teotihuacan's cultural influence into the fabric of Tikal society would ultimately help shape the city's unique identity, a blend of Mayan and Teotihuacan traditions.", "text3": "Lady Unen Bahlam's ceremonial performance at an interesting time hints at a potential power shift in Tikal's male-dominated hierarchy. The ceremony could have been a way for Lady Unen to establish her right to rule or to ensure her role as regent for a young or incapacitated leader. Her ability to conduct a katun-ending ceremony suggests she may have wielded considerable power. The fact that Teotihuacan embassies were already established in Tikal by 200 AD demonstrates the strong trade and diplomatic connections between the two civilizations. Teotihuacan's extensive trade networks and alliances with Mesoamerican states, including Tikal, played a significant role in the city's path to power. The trade and diplomatic connections between Teotihuacan and Tikal through the exchange of ambassadors and goods would have strengthened their relationship and impacted the cultural and architectural growth of Tikal. In the late 3rd century AD, Teotihuacan's influence on Tikal is evident in the elaborate construction of structures like the North Temple and Temple I, which showcase Teotihuacan-inspired frescoes and architectural elements.

After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary. Off-site, the new brake wheel and fantail were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast-iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly. The fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft. The stocks and sails were made during the two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made. The long stocks were made from Douglas fir.

Bolstered by his support of President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes. Beckham served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the US Department of Labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the US Bullion Depository. After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations. True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919 but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times. The Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas that those industries were prominent, Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M.

Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3% of the vote to Beckham's 49.7&%. During his only term in the Senate, Beckham served alongside three other US Senators from Kentucky: Ollie M. James, George B. Martin, and Augustus O. Stanley. After his term in the Senate ended, Beckham resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time, he had the support of the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful political machine, known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks.

{"prefix": "Mycena inclinata, commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak-stump bonnet cap, is a species of mushroom in the family Mycenaceae. The doubtfully edible mushroom has a reddish-brown bell-shaped cap up to in diameter.", "gold": "The thin stem is up to tall, whitish to yellow-brown at the top but progressively becoming reddish-brown towards the base in maturity, where they are covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem. The gills are pale brown to pinkish, and the spore print is white. It is a widespread saprobic fungus, and has been found in Europe, North Africa, Asia, Australasia, and North America, where it grows in small groups or tufts on fallen logs and stumps, especially of oak. British mycologist E.J.H. Corner has described two varieties of the mushroom from Borneo. Lookalike species with which M. inclinata may be confused include M. galericulata and M. maculata. First described as Agaricus inclinatus by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1838, it was assigned its current name in 1872 by Lucien Qu\u00e9let. Mycena galericulata var. calopus (named by Karsten in 1879), and its basionym Agaricus galericulatus var. calopus (named by Fries in 1873), are synonyms. In a molecular study of the large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the orchid Gastrodia confusa, M. inclinata was found to be closely related to M. aurantiomarginata, M. crocata, and M. leaiana. The specific epithet inclinata means \"bent in\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \"clustered bonnet\" or the \"oak-stump bonnet cap\". The cap is light reddish-brown, with a diameter typically ranging from . Initially conic to bell-shaped to convex, it flattens during maturity, developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap. The margin of the cap has minute but distinct scallops. The surface is moist and smooth, and hygrophanous.", "text1": "The cap is typically 2-5 cm in diameter and has a slight incline, giving it a unique, bell-like shape. The surface of the cap is smooth and sticky, with a fine, downy texture. The gills are crowded and adnate (attached) to the stem, with a creamy white color that turns yellowish-brown as they mature. The stem is usually 2-5 cm tall and 0.5-1 cm thick, with a similar reddish-brown color to the cap.\n\nMycena inclinata is often found growing in clusters on decaying oak stumps, from which it derives its common name. It is typically found in woodland areas, particularly in the understory of mature oak forests. The mushroom typically fruits in late summer to early fall, although it can be found year-round in warmer climates.\n\nDespite its questionable edibility, Mycena inclinata is highly prized by mycologists and mushroom enthusiasts for its unique appearance and habitat. It is considered a rare and sought-after find, and is often collected for its use in scientific research and educational programs.", "text2": "The cap of Mycena inclinata has a smooth, glossy surface and is attached to a thin, hairy stem that can grow up to 10 cm tall. The species is known to grow in clusters or large numbers around the bases of trees, particularly oak and hazel, and is commonly found in woodland floors in Europe and North America. Despite its attractive appearance, the mushroom's edibility is uncertain, and its consumption should only be attempted by experienced foragers or professionals. In addition to the risk of toxicity, the mushroom's flavor and texture may also not be pleasing to the palate, making it one of the more cautious species of the fungi kingdom.", "text3": "The smooth, glossy cap of Mycena inclinata is connected to a slender, hairy stem that can reach a height of 10 cm.

{"prefix": "The easiest and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A+ in mountaineering parlance. Mount Elbert is therefore often referred to as the \"gentle giant\" that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains.", "gold": "Mount Elbert is visible to the southwest of Leadville, often snow-capped even in the summer. Many other fourteeners surround Elbert in all directions, and it is very close to central Colorado's Collegiate Peaks. The neighboring Mount Massive, to the north, is the second-highest peak in the Rocky Mountains and the third-highest in the contiguous United States, and La Plata Peak, to the south, is the fifth-highest in the Rockies. The community of Twin Lakes lies at the base of Mount Elbert, Denver is about to the east, Vail is to the north, and Aspen is to the west. Leadville, about to the northeast, is the nearest large town. Elbert's parent peak is Mount Whitney in California. Including Alaska and Hawaii, Mount Elbert is the fourteenth-highest mountain in the United States. Weather conditions often change rapidly, and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summertime; hailstorms and snow are possible year-round. An electrical storm on the mountain's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the July 1894 issue of Science. Mount Elbert is part of the Sawatch Range, an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which separated from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily glaciated, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of Elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded, which lie on a lateral moraine. Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam. Mount Elbert is composed largely of quartzite. However, the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock, which is Pre-Cambrian in origin and about 1.7 billion years old. There are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite, as well as bands of gneiss and schist. Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which can be attributed to its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.", "text1": "Despite its relatively easy climbing routes, Mount Elbert still presents some challenges for even the most seasoned climbers. The high altitude and unpredictable weather patterns in the Rocky Mountains can quickly turn a pleasant day hike into a harrowing experience. Snow and ice cover the mountain's upper reaches for much of the year, requiring climbers to navigate steep and slippery terrain. Additionally, the mountain's exposed summit can be whipped by strong winds, making it essential for climbers to be prepared with sturdy gear and a solid understanding of avalanche safety.\n\nDespite these challenges, many visitors to Mount Elbert are rewarded with breathtaking views from the summit. On a clear day, it's possible to see for hundreds of miles in every direction, taking in the rugged peaks of the Sawatch Range and the vast expanse of the Rocky Mountains. For those who reach the top, the sense of accomplishment is unmatched, and the memories of this majestic \"gentle giant\" will stay with them forever.", "text2": "As you ascend Mount Elbert's well-traveled trails, the views of the Sawatch Range and surrounding valleys unfold like a canvas of grandeur. The mountain's moderate inclines and well-graded trails make it accessible to climbers of all experience levels. The scent of pine and wildflowers fills the crisp alpine air, and the sound of rushing water provides a constant serenade from the nearby La Plata River.\n\nFrom the summit's elevated platform, the panorama stretches out in every direction, a breathtaking tapestry of peaks, valleys, and rugged landscapes. On a clear day, the eye can discern the towering Rocky Mountains stretching westward, while the distant San Juan Range rises majestically to the southwest.\n\nBut Mount Elbert's charm goes beyond its physical grandeur. The mountain holds a rich cultural significance, with evidence of human occupation dating back over 10,000 years. The Ute and Cheyenne tribes revered this sacred ground, and many consider it a spiritual home. Today, climbers and hikers alike seek to honor this land by respecting its natural beauty and respecting the traditions of the indigenous people who first climbed these storied peaks.", "text3": "While hiking up Mount Elbert's popular paths, you will be treated to stunning views of the Sawatch Range and nearby valleys.

Until 2012, Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats, and before the 2010 general election he endorsed Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. In 2012, however, Radcliffe switched his allegiance to the Labour Party, citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in government, and approving of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. In August 2015, Radcliffe endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

Along with Lauderdale County and the city of Marion, Meridian is served by the East Mississippi Business Development Corporation, which was formed in 1996 by a group of business leaders from the area. While as of April 2010, the city's civilian labor force was only 15,420 people, there is a population of 232,900 in a radius and 526,500 in a radius, of which 104,600 and 234,200 people respectively are in the labor force. The city thus serves as a hub of employment, retail, health care, and culture activities. Eighty percent of Lauderdale County's workers reside in the county while 90% live within 45 miles. In April 2020, there were 5,101 people employed in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Health Systems is the largest healthcare organization in the region, employing 2,465 people, followed by Anderson Regional Health System with 1,343 and East Mississippi State Hospital with 943. There are two hospitals in Meridian, as well as many other healthcare-related facilities. Anderson Regional Medical Center provides cardiovascular surgery, a Level II newborn intensive-care unit, and a health and fitness center. In December 2010, Anderson bought Riley Hospital and absorbed its employees and stroke treatment center and rehabilitation services. Rush Foundation Hospital and the related Rush Health Systems operate a Specialty Hospital of Meridian, which offers long-term care for non-permanent patients who require more recovery time in a hospital setting.

At 11:00, the rest of Edson's men landed. With this reinforcement and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft, Edson's force pushed into the village. The Japanese defenders, believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an Allied supply ship convoy heading towards Lunga Point, retreated into the jungle, leaving behind 27 dead. Two Marines were killed. In Tasimboko, Edson's troops discovered the supply base for Kawaguchi's forces, including large stockpiles of food, ammunition and medical supplies, and a shortwave radio. The Marines seized documents, equipment and food supplies, destroyed the rest, and returned to the Lunga perimeter at 17:30.

Edson and Colonel Gerald Thomas, Vandegrift's operations officer, believed that the Japanese attack would come at the Lunga Ridge, a narrow, grassy, long, coral ridge () parallel to the Lunga River just south of Henderson Field. The ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended. Edson and Thomas tried to persuade Vandegrift to move forces to defend the ridge, but Vandegrift refused, believing that the Japanese were more likely to attack along the coast. Finally, Thomas convinced Vandegrift that the ridge was a good location for Edson's Raiders to \"rest\" from their actions of the preceding month.

During the early years of the 1880s, an Egyptian regime in the Sudan, backed by the British, came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad (or Ahmed), known as Mahdi to his followers. In 1883, as part of the Mahdist War, the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt, but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces. The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan, and sent General Charles Gordon to co-ordinate the evacuation, but he was killed in January 1885. When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885, the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent's expenses. The New South Wales Contingent consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers, and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885. The contingent arrived in Suakin on 29 March and were attached to a brigade that consisted of Scots, Grenadier and Coldstream Guards. They subsequently marched for Tamai in a large \"square\" formation made up of 10,000 men. Reaching the village, they burned huts and returned to Suakin: three Australians were wounded in minor fighting. Most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards Berber, on the Nile. The Australians were then assigned to guard duties, but soon a camel corps was raised and 50 men volunteered. They rode on a reconnaissance to Takdul on 6 May and were heavily involved in a skirmish during which more than 100 Arabs were killed or captured. On 15 May, they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous March. Meanwhile, the artillery were posted at Handoub and drilled for a month, but they soon rejoined the camp at Suakin. Eventually the British government decided that the campaign in Sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in Suakin. The New South Wales Contingent sailed for home on 17 May, arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885. Approximately 770 Australians served in Sudan; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign.", "text1": "The Royal Australian Navy's (RAN) early years were marked by a gradual expansion and modernization of its fleet. In the early 1900s, the RAN began to take on a more prominent role in the Commonwealth's defense strategy, with a focus on protecting Australia's maritime trade routes and defending against potential threats from the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nOne significant milestone in this period was the introduction of the \"one naval officer to each ship\" policy, which aimed to professionalize the RAN and establish a more standardized system of command and control. This policy, implemented in 1901, led to the creation of a more cohesive and effective naval force, with officers trained in modern naval tactics and strategies.\n\nThe RAN also continued to develop its shore-based facilities, with the establishment of new naval bases and depots at ports such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. These facilities played a critical role in supporting the RAN's fleet, providing maintenance, repair, and logistics services to ships on deployment.\n\nDespite these advancements, the RAN still faced significant challenges in the early 20th century. One major hurdle was the lack of a unified command structure, with naval units often reporting directly to the respective state governments rather than to a central authority. This led to duplication of effort, confusion, and inefficiencies, and it would take several decades for the RAN to achieve true federal control.\n\nNonetheless, the RAN continued to grow and evolve throughout the early 20th century, playing a vital role in Australia's defense and contributing to several key international conflicts, including World War I and World War II. The lessons learned from these conflicts would shape the RAN's development and contribute to its emergence as a powerful and respected naval force in the Asia-Pacific region.", "text2": "As the turn of the century approached, the naval forces of the Australian colonies continued to play a crucial role in the region's defence.

The new RAN was initially composed of eight ships, including four cruisers, two destroyers, and two support vessels.\n\nDuring the first decades of the 20th century, the RAN continued to expand, with the addition of newer, more modern vessels and the establishment of naval bases in both major Australian cities. The fleet played an important role in the country's defence during the First World War, with Australian ships participating in naval operations in the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and the North Sea.\n\nIn the interwar period, the RAN continued to grow and modernize, with the introduction of newer aircraft, radar, and anti-submarine equipment.

{"prefix": "After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory. By the 7th century, there was no active Teotihuacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had been razed by 700.", "gold": "Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style. Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today. In 738, Quirigu\u00e1, a vassal of Cop\u00e1n, Tikal's key ally in the south, switched allegiance to Calakmul, defeated Cop\u00e1n and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Cop\u00e1n. In the 8th century, the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis. By the late 8th century and early 9th century, activity at Tikal slowed. Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers. By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence.", "text1": "As the once-mighty Teotihuacanos faded into memory, Calakmul continued to thrive, becoming the dominant power in the region.

Many were forced to flee their homeland, seeking refuge in other parts of Mesoamerica. Some eventually settled in the Valley of Oaxaca, where they would go on to establish a new culture, known as Zapotec.\n\nDespite the decline of Teotihuacan, its legacy continued to shape the Maya civilization. The Teotihuacanos had introduced new agricultural practices, architecture, and artistic styles to the region, which the Maya adopted and adapted to their own purposes. The result was a unique blend of Teotihuacano and Maya cultures, which would go on to define the course of Mesoamerican history for centuries to come.\n\nAs the centuries passed, Calakmul continued to grow in power and influence, eventually becoming one of the most important city-states in the Maya world.

There are six bridges along current or former sections of US 2 that MDOT has added to its listing of Michigan's Historic Bridges; two of these are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). A third bridge added to the NRHP in late 2012 has not been added to MDOT's listing however. The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River, which has since been bypassed by a new bridge. The original structure, dating to 1918, is a spandrel arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. 191. The structure was listed on the NRHP on December 9, 1999, for its architectural and engineering significance. In December 2012, the National Park Service approved the listing of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the Menominee River northwest of Iron Mountain. The structure is a single-span, pin-connected, camelback, through-truss bridge, and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan. It was built between 1909 and 1910 because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing. The span cost $5,106 (equivalent to $ in ), paid equally by Dickinson and Florence counties. Until the 1930s, the Upper Twin Falls Bridge carried US 2 across the Menominee River. In 1934, a new bridge was built about a mile downstream, and the highway was rerouted over the new span. The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September 1971, and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012. In 2003, MDOT replaced the Sturgeon River Bridge in Waucedah Township, Dickinson County. , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced, MDOT retained it on their historic bridge list. It was built in 1929. Before 1983, US 2 used a different routing through Manistique and crossed the Manistique River on what is nicknamed the \"Siphon Bridge\". Built as a part of a raceway flume on the river, the water level is actually higher than the road surface. This produces a siphon effect, giving the bridge its nickname. The Manistique Pulp and Paper Company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the Manistique River to supply their mill.", "text1": "As part of the UP Hidden Coast Recreational Heritage Trail, the scenic byway stretches for 55 miles from the town of Escanaba to the town of Rapid River, showcasing the remnants of Michigan's rich mining and logging heritage.

{"prefix": "\"The Bourgeois Blues\" is a blues song by American folk and blues musician Lead Belly. It was written in June 1937 in response to the discrimination and segregation that Lead Belly faced during a visit to Washington, DC to record for Alan Lomax.", "gold": "It rails against racism, the Jim Crow laws, and the conditions of contemporary African Americans in the southern United States. The song was recorded in December 1938 for the Library of Congress and re-recorded in 1939 for commercial release.

He spent his days exploring the city, taking in the sights and sounds of the bustling streets and landmarks like the White House and the Capitol Building. But as he walked through the city, he couldn't help but notice the stark contrast between the opulence and privilege he saw around him and the stark realities of segregation and discrimination that African Americans like himself faced.\n\nThe lyrics to \"The Bourgeois Blues\" poured out of him, a scathing critique of the racial divide that had become so ingrained in American society. With his unique blend of folk and blues styles, Lead Belly sang of the indignities and injustices he had faced, from being refused service at restaurants to being shunned by white society. The song was a powerful expression of Lead Belly's outrage and frustration, but also his hope and determination to use his music as a means of bringing about change.\n\nOver the next few days, Lead Belly continued to refine the song, working closely with Alan Lomax to get the lyrics just right. When they finally recorded the song, the result was a haunting and powerful performance that captured the raw emotion and urgency of Lead Belly's message. \"The Bourgeois Blues\" would go on to become one of Lead Belly's most famous songs, and a testament to the enduring power of music to challenge and change the world.", "text2": "During the visit, Lead Belly's attempts to visit landmarks and institutions in the nation's capital were thwarted by segregationist policies and racist hostility. Despite his growing frustration and disappointment, he found solace in his music and penned \"The Bourgeois Blues\" as a scathing rebuke to the status quo. The song's lyrics, delivered in his powerful and haunting vocals, spoke directly to the struggles and injustices faced by African Americans during the Great Depression and beyond.\n\nUpon his return to New York, Lead Belly brought the song to the attention of Alan Lomax, who was impressed by the song's poignant and powerful indictment of the societal ills. Lomax worked with Lead Belly to prepare the song for recording, and \"The Bourgeois Blues\" was finally released on the Folkways label in 1946. The song became an underground anthem for many who fought against racial segregation and discrimination in the United States, and its message continues to resonate with contemporary social justice movements.", "text3": "Segregationist policies and racist hostility prevented Lead Belly from visiting landmarks and institutions in the nation's capital during his visit.

Nosek and three friends had come to attend the concert from Vrchlab\u00ed, a town in mountains some northeast of Prague. They described Nosek as a huge fan of Lamb of God who had been able to secure an autograph from a guitar player before the concert had started. Nosek's friend Jan Jebav\u00fd testified that Nosek climbed the stage, and as he turned around towards the crowd he was pushed by Blythe off the stage. He said he was \"100% sure Blythe pushed Nosek with both hands.\" He further said that Blythe's behavior deviated from all the concerts he had attended in the past, commenting that Blythe was visibly furious. He further claimed that Nosek was not the first person to be chased off the stage by Blythe, with another fan being kicked, choked and receiving a punch from Blythe. Jebav\u00fd corroborated Blythe's testimony that Blythe asked \"Are you okay?\" after Nosek fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply. However, as Nosek fell sick after the concert, they called him an ambulance. According to Jebav\u00fd, the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it. Nosek's other friend Ond\u0159ej Vlach testified that Nosek's fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break.

The detective alleged that the band had been trying to reach out to Daniel to discuss a potential tour date and had even offered him a private meeting with the lead singer.\n\nThe defense team, however, disputed the detective's claims, arguing that the emails and phone records were fake or had been tampered with.

As the subtropical ridge north of the storm weakened, Beatriz acquired a more northerly component to its track, bringing the center of the storm closer to Mexico. Convective bands gradually wrapped around the system throughout the day. During the afternoon hours of June 20, a hurricane hunter aircraft found Beatriz just below hurricane strength, and subsequently, the system was upgraded just a few hours later, while situated roughly 85 mi (140 km) southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. Early on June 21, a wide eye developed within the central dense overcast. In light of this, the National Hurricane Center estimated Beatriz to have attained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) along with a barometric pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg); however, it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of 105 mph (165 km/h) from the University of Wisconsin and the Satellite Analysis Branch. Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi (20 km) south-southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico.

In response to quick degradation of the system's structure, the NHC downgraded Beatriz to a tropical storm. Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours, the storm no longer had a defined circulation. Lacking an organized center and deep convection, the final advisory was issued on Beatriz. The storm's remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly 175 mi (280 km) southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco.

The video for \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was directed by Meiert Avis and produced by Michael Hamlyn and Ben Dossett. The band attracted over 1,000 people during the video's filming, which took place on the rooftop of a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles on 27 March 1987. The band's performance on a rooftop in a public place was a reference to the Beatles' final concert, as depicted in the film Let It Be. During the shoot U2 played an eight-song set, which included four performances of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". Prior to filming, a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be intruded by a group of fans. A backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator, which happened during filming. The depiction of the police attempting to shut down the filming due to safety concerns actually happened during filming, just as seen in the video. Hamlyn was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police. According to Avis, the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day \"almost in real time\", and that \"getting busted was an integral part of the plan.\" Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to dramatize the music video, but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video. In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel, which was rebuilt to create some interest, in case no one showed up at the film shoot. Although the video is of a live performance, the audio used is from the studio-recorded version of the song.

Critics cited the fast gameplay, unprecedented in platformers.", "gold": "The difficulty was disputed, described as \"impossible\" by Rand and \"average\" by EGM. Rand said about the gameplay in general that it \"plays like a dream\"; according to GameZone it would enchant players for hours, and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team's ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping. Although EGM, Dragon, Paul of Mean Machines and Boardman of Raze praised the level design (especially the hidden rooms), Paul found losing all of one's rings frustrating. Sonic the Hedgehog has maintained its popularity, and has since been considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Frank Provo of GameSpot described the game as \"one of the best platformers of all time\", finding that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port \"after all these years, the underlying graphics, audio, and gameplay still hold up\". Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time. Writing in The Guardian, Keith Stuart observed that Sonic the Hedgehogs emphasis on speed and pinball mechanics dramatically departs from generally accepted precepts of game design, requiring that players \"learn through repetition rather than observation\" as \"the levels aren't designed to be seen or even understood in one playthrough.\" However, Stuart concluded that \"sometimes in Sonic, when you get better, or through sheer luck, things take off, every jump is right, every loop-the-loop is perfect, and you're in the flow, sailing above the game's strange structure ... Sonic is incorrect game design and yet ... it's a masterpiece.\" Mega ranked Sonic as its third-favorite Genesis game, and in 2001 Game Informer called it the 24th-greatest game of all time. Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success; the original Genesis version bundled with the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive hardware had sold over 15 million copies by February 2009, and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by 2008. Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly gave the game an A+ and wrote that it was a very fast game, yet never felt chaotic or impossible, and they later named it the best game available in 1991. Primarily because of its Genesis bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog popularized the console in North America, thus making it a competitor to Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System. During October\u2013December 1991, the Genesis outsold the Super NES by two to one; at its January 1992 peak it had 65 percent of the market for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually overtook Sega, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo did not lead the console market.", "text1": "Despite Boardman's lukewarm reception, Raze's music, and the innovative gameplay, the game still managed to gain a cult following among gamers. The unique mechanics, which allowed for swift platforming and daring leaps, resonated with players who craved a challenge.

Some praised its bold approach to platforming, citing the thrill of navigating treacherous terrain and the sense of accomplishment that came with overcoming its demanding levels. Others, like Boardman, felt that the game's quick pace and lack of diversity in its music and graphics detracted from the overall experience.\n\nDespite the mixed opinions, Raze went on to inspire a new wave of platformers, many of which borrowed from its innovative gameplay mechanics. The game's influence could be seen in titles that followed, each trying to refine and improve upon Raze's formula.

Australian opposition to the Republican cause was marshalled by B.A. Santamaria on an anti-communist basis, rather than a pro-Nationalist basis. Equally, although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels, they received no public support. Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time, however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist, no action was taken. Consequently, returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL).

At the time of the declaration of war against Germany the Australian military was small and unready for war. Recruiting for a Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) began in mid-September. While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid-1940. Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East. The RAAF's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), through which almost 28,000 Australians were trained during the war.

The Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated the Club's relatively-obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. Flem D. Sampson, the Club's nominee in the Republican primary, won his party's nomination. In the general election, Beckham could not secure the support of Democratic Governor William J.

Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, Beckham lost to Sampson by more than 32,000 votes, with voting fraud suspected but never proved. It was estimated that the Club spent over $500,000 to defeat him.

Starr taped the basic track at Evergreen Recording Studios in Los Angeles on 4 November 1980, with additional recording taking place on 1\u20135 December at Nassau's Compass Point Studios. Among the large cast of musicians supporting Starr were Nilsson (vocals), Jim Keltner (drums), Jane Getz (piano), Dennis Budimir and Richie Zito (guitars), and a four-piece horn section led by saxophonist Jerry Jumonville. Starr overdubbed his vocals on 4 December, four days before the murder of John Lennon, who had been due to record his contributions to Stop and Smell the Roses in January 1981.

At one point during the battle, the flag Moultrie had designed and raised over the fort was shot down. Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again, holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided.

Patriots in small boats sailed out to the burning ships, and fired some of their cannons at the British ships, took what stores and loot they could, and retreated shortly before the ship's powder magazine exploded. The British did not attempt to take the fort again. Within days of the battle, Charlestonians learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. The British troops were reembarked on their transports, and on July 21 the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in its campaign against New York City.

Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble), new members of the Fringe division, are called to investigate by division head Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick), believing the case to be part of \"The Pattern\", a string of mysterious incidents. The woman is identified as having recently left a local motel, and Olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder case she and her former partner John Scott were not able to solve. Olivia explains to Peter that their murderer would paralyze his victims, young women, then make an incision along their face to extract a piece of brain material, killing the victim in the process. Walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth, her child having accelerated aging disease. Walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field, and remembers where he stashed his car that contains the related files. Once they are retrieved, Olivia makes a connection to the pituitary gland which controls growth in humans, and informs Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) to monitor recent cases where the victims' pituitary gland has been removed.", "text1": "The episode, which premiered on September 9, 2008, introduced audiences to FBI Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), who was tasked with investigating a series of unexplained phenomena and events.

Despite the controversy and the resulting delay in the release of Reign in Blood, the song remains a live favorite, and has appeared on all of Slayer's live albums. The song has been described as highly influential in the development of thrash metal or speed metal, and is highly regarded by some critics; AllMusic's Steve Huey called it a classic and the album \"the pinnacle of speed metal\". The half-time riff was sampled by Public Enemy in their 1988 song \"She Watch Channel Zero?!.\" Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote \"Angel of Death\" after reading books about Nazi physician Josef Mengele while on tour with the band.

The song's title, \"Angel of Death\", is a reference to the Grim Reaper, the mythical figure who is said to guide souls to the afterlife. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a person who is tired of the pain and suffering of life, and welcomes death as a way to escape the struggles and hardships.\n\nAs the song builds towards its climax, the guitar work becomes increasingly complex, with Hanneman's signature chord progressions and soloing adding depth and texture to the track.

Radcliffe's performance was criticised by The New York Times film critic A. O. Scott, who felt that co-star Emma Watson had to carry him with her performance. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and Radcliffe singled out the humour as a reason for the film's creative success. The future of the franchise was put into question when Radcliffe, Watson, and co-star Rupert Grint hesitated to sign on to continue their roles. By March 2007, however, Radcliffe had signed for the final Harry Potter films; his signing put an end to weeks of press \"speculation that he would be denied the role due to his involvement in Equus\", in which he had performed nude onstage. Radcliffe reprised the role of Harry for the fourth time in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007). Radcliffe stated that director David Yates and co-star Imelda Staunton made Order of the Phoenix the \"most fun\" film to work on in the series. His performance earned him several award nominations, and he received the 2008 National Movie Award for \"Best Male Performance.\" Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson left imprints of their hands, feet, and wands in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the series' sixth instalment, was released in July 2009. Radcliffe received nominations for \"Best Male Performance\" and \"Global Superstar\" at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards. For financial and scripting reasons, the last Harry Potter book (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows) was divided into two films that were shot back-to-back. This decision drew criticism from the series' fans, but Radcliffe defended the split, stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film.

German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007, but abandoned the initiative a year later, finding insufficient legal grounds. As of 2017, polls suggest that half of Germans supported banning Scientology, while over two-thirds considered Scientology dangerous. Scientology, founded in the early 1950s in the United States by L. Ron Hubbard and today claiming to be represented in 150 countries, has been a very controversial new religious movement. Its stated utopian aim is to \"clear the planet\", to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations. Scientology teaches that the source of people's unhappiness lies in \"engrams\", psychological burdens acquired in the course of painful experiences, which can be cleared through a type of counselling called \"auditing\" made available by the Church of Scientology. The fact that Scientologists have to pay large fees for auditing and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history, with governments classing it as a profit-making enterprise rather than as a religion. Critics maintain that Scientology is \"a business-driven, psychologically manipulative, totalitarian ideology with world-dominating aspirations\", and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for Scientology courses. Scientology has fought innumerable lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion. These efforts have been partly successful \u2013 Scientology has gained recognition as a tax-exempt religious group in a number of countries, most notably in Australia in 1983 and the United States in 1993, and in 2007 won an important case at the European Court of Human Rights, which censured Russia for failing to register Scientology as a religion.

{"prefix": "Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers. By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence.", "gold": "Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once-great power was little more than a memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem glyph. As Tikal and its hinterland reached peak population, the area suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels. Recent analysis also indicates that the city's freshwater sources became highly contaminated with mercury, phosphate and cyanobacteria leading to the accumulation of toxins. Tikal and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbat\u00fan region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources. In the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much-diminished city of Tikal, as evidenced by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by Jasaw Chan K'awiil II in 869.

The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on 30 September 1947, while the CMF was re-raised on 1 July 1948. In the immediate post-war period Australia contributed significant forces to the Allied occupation of Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), which included forces from Australia, Britain, India and New Zealand. At its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade, four warships and three fighter squadrons, totalling 13,500 personnel. The Australian Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in Hiroshima Prefecture. The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949, and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948, forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army. From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion. Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations, although by that time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean peninsula following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950.

Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple-block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the \"butterfly binding\" (hudie zhuang, ) style, whereby whole-folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double-page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, 2015.

The New South Wales Mounted Rifles and Western Australians saw action again at Diamond Hill on 12 June. Mafeking was relieved on 17 May. Following the defeat of the Afrikaner republics still the Boers held out, forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply. This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the Bushmen's Contingents, with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse-riding and shooting skills, but little military experience. After Federation in 1901, eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa, although they saw little fighting before the war ended. Some Australians later joined local South African irregular units, instead of returning home after discharge. These soldiers were part of the British Army, and were subject to British military discipline. Such units included the Bushveldt Carbineers which gained notoriety as the unit in which Harry \"Breaker\" Morant and Peter Handcock served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes.

During the night the defenders dug in, enduring shelling and rifle fire. A relief force was stopped by the Boers, while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved. The siege lasted 11 days, during which more than 1,800 shells were fired into the post. After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders, and not prepared to risk a frontal attack, the Boers eventually retired. The Siege of Elands River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war, with the post finally relieved on 16 August. In response the British adopted counter-insurgency tactics, including a scorched earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops, the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children, and a system of blockhouses and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications. Such measures required considerable expenditure, and caused much bitterness towards the British, however they soon yielded results.

As is often the case with huge ancient ruins, knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people never forgot about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto M\u00e9ndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Pet\u00e9n, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s. In 1951, a small airstrip was built at the ruins, which previously could only be reached by several days' travel through the jungle on foot or mule. In 1956 the Tikal project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area. From 1956 through 1970, major archaeological excavations were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania Tikal Project. They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures. Excavations directed by Edwin M. Shook and later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from 1957 to 1969. The Tikal Project recorded over 200 monuments at the site. In 1979, the Guatemalan government began a further archeological project at Tikal, which continued through to 1984.", "text1": "As a result, the once-thriving city began to show signs of decline, with the effects of mercury pollution causing widespread health problems for its inhabitants. Birth defects, neurological disorders, and even death became more common, as the population struggled to survive in a environment that was rapidly becoming uninhabitable. The city's economy, once driven by industry and innovation, began to stagnate as businesses closed and people left in search of safer and healthier living conditions. Despite efforts to address the issue, the city's government and corporate leaders were slow to respond, and it wasn't until a group of activist scientists sounded the alarm that the full extent of the damage became known.

The city officials, mired in corruption and cronyism, refused to take responsibility for the crisis, instead blaming the citizens themselves for failing to adapt to the changing environmental conditions.\n\nSofia and her fellow activists decided to take matters into their own hands. They formed an underground resistance movement, dubbed \"El Fuego,\" which aimed to expose the city officials' corruption and force them to take drastic action.\n\nUsing guerrilla tactics, El Fuego members sabotaged key infrastructure and hijacked city-wide broadcasts to air scathing critiques of the officials' inaction. The movement gained momentum, with more and more residents joining their cause.\n\nMeanwhile, the city's inequalities continued to grow, with the wealthy few holding onto power and influence, while the majority struggled to access even the most basic services.

The consortium took possession of the mill in November 1979. The first priority was to make the mill as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame. A two-week work-in was held at the end of July and beginning of August 1980. Thirty-three volunteers worked on the mill over the work-in. Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from baulks of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at Bury St Edmunds. On 3 August 1980, the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane, followed by the cap frame and the cast-iron curb sections. New oak joists were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower. The bin floor was removed, apart from one oak main beam which was repairable. A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine, and the oak beam was repaired. New oak joists were fitted, along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused. One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail. Some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the Eastbridge Windpump, which, following its collapse on 19 February 1977, had been re-erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life, Stowmarket. The sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair, brickwork was repaired, and new lintels were made for some of the windows. A tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter. The floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed. The work was financed by grants of \u00a3500 from the Council for the Preservation of Rural Essex, \u00a3250 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council, \u00a3200 from the Scarfe Trust, and \u00a3200 from the Suffolk Mills Group.

It is about long and wide. The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene. A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure. The caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago. The caldera contains significant ore deposits, and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera. Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. The Trout Creek Mountains are semi-arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range, most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the Trout Creek Mountains. As a result, the average annual precipitation in the Trout Creek Mountains is only per year, with most areas receiving between annually. Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June. Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months. Snowpack at elevations below usually melts by April; however, at the higher elevations, snow can remain until mid-June. Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the snowpack melts. The prevailing winds are from the west-southwest, and they are normally strongest in March and April. Brief, intense thunderstorms are common between April and October. Thunderstorms in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes. Vegetation in the Trout Creek Mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses. Other common shrubs include bitterbrush, snowberry, and Ceanothus. There are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas. Common grass species include Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, cheatgrass, western needlegrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail, as well as basin wildrye in some well-drained areas.

After two straight second-place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \"push\", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end. After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race, Dale Earnhardt made up three seconds on Richmond's five-second lead. With four laps to go, Buddy Arrington spun in a three-car accident.

{"prefix": "While there have been calls for Scientology to be banned, the Church of Scientology remains legal in Germany and is allowed to operate there. Its precise legal status however is unresolved.", "gold": "Two points are contested: first, whether or not the teachings of Scientology qualify as a \"religion or worldview\" (Religion or Weltanschauung; these are equal before German law), and secondly, whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity; if the latter were the case, this would most likely imply that Scientology would not qualify for protection as a \"religious or worldview community\" (Religions- oder Weltanschauungsgemeinschaft) under Article 4 of the German constitution, which guarantees the freedom of belief, religion and worldview. Status as a \"religious or worldview community\" also affects a broad range of other issues in Germany, such as taxation and freedom of association. The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter, but implicitly assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or worldview community. The Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that Scientology should be viewed as a worldview community. In 1995, the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or worldview community entitled to protection under Article 4 of the German Constitution, although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003. In another 2003 decision, the Administrative Court of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Mannheim said there were no indications that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity. In 2005, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4.1 of the German Constitution, which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate. Many courts have declined to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion. Recent years have seen a number of court decisions in Scientology's favour, despite the very widespread negative attitude to Scientology among politicians and the general public.", "text1": "Despite being allowed to operate, the Church of Scientology faces significant restrictions in Germany. In 1979, the German government declared Scientology a \"commercial enterprise\" rather than a recognized religion, citing concerns over its tax-exempt status and allegations of financial irregularities. This classification has limited the Church's ability to expand and operate freely in the country.\n\nIn addition, several German states have imposed specific regulations on Scientology, including requirements for the organization to register its activities with local authorities and provide detailed financial information. These regulations have been met with resistance from the Church, which claims they are discriminatory and aimed at stifling its religious freedom.\n\nThe German government's stance on Scientology is also shaped by concerns over the Church's controversial history. In the 1970s and 1980s, several German Scientologists were involved in high-profile lawsuits and disputes, including a notable case in which a German citizen accused the Church of brainwashing and financial exploitation. These events have contributed to a pervasive sense of distrust towards Scientology among the German public and government officials.\n\nAs a result, the Church of Scientology continues to operate in Germany under a cloud of uncertainty, with its legal status and ability to expand its activities subject to ongoing controversy and debate. While it is technically legal, the Church's operations are heavily regulated and monitored, and it remains a highly controversial and polarizing presence in German society.", "text2": "The church claims to be a religious organization, but the German government has yet to officially recognize it as such.

The government, meanwhile, has argued that it is necessary to protect citizens from what it sees as the harmful practices and financial exploitation associated with the organization.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Scientology, the organization remains a relatively small and largely ineffective presence in Germany, with estimates suggesting that it has just a few hundred members in the country. Nevertheless, the debate over Scientology's status continues to generate significant attention and debate, with many German citizens remaining skeptical of the organization's true intentions and motivations.\n\nIn recent years, the dispute has led to increased tensions between the government and Scientologists, with many church members reporting harassment, intimidation and physical abuse by German authorities and anti-Scientology extremists. The Church of Scientology has responded by calling on the government to take measures to protect its members from these actions and to ensure their right to practice their religion freely.", "text3": "The church asserts its status as a religious organization, but the German government has not yet acknowledged it officially.

The war remained limited, and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo, although a number of Indonesian seaborne and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur. As part of Australia's continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia, army, naval and airforce units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only. On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help mop up infiltrators from seaborne and airborne incursions at Labis and Pontian, in September and October 1964. Following these raids the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo. During the early phases, British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the Malaysian/Indonesian border, and to protect population centres. However, by the time the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing the border into Kalimantan to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation Claret. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross-border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions. 3 RAR deployed to Borneo in March 1965, and served in Sarawak until the end of July, operating on both sides of the border.

In 1985, the final season that Richmond competed for Beadle, his best finish was a second-place run at Bristol. He ended the season 11th in points with 13 Top 10s in 28 races. In the Busch Series, he qualified at the pole position in the two races he entered, and won the Charlotte race. Richmond joined Hendrick Motorsports in 1986, where he teamed up with veteran crew chief Harry Hyde. It took the team until the middle of the season to gel. Richmond had suffered a 64-race winless streak that was finally broken at the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500 at Pocono in June 1986. After two straight second-place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \"push\", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end. After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race, Dale Earnhardt made up three seconds on Richmond's five-second lead. With four laps to go, Buddy Arrington spun in a three-car accident. The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the checkered flag for the victory.

He instructed them not to, according to his memoirs, telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme duress, and that it would not do to attack them. Many Rhodesians also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments, especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target. At a memorial service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets.

Additional critics were the sociologist Thomas Brown, who had been preparing an article on Churchill's work, and the historians R.G. Robertson and Russell Thornton, who said that Churchill had misrepresented their work. In 2005, University of Colorado Boulder administrators ordered an investigation into seven allegations of research misconduct, including three allegations of plagiarism, and four allegations of fabrication or falsification regarding the history of the Dawes Act, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, and repeated claims that smallpox was intentionally spread to Native Americans by John Smith in 1614 and by the United States Army at Fort Clark in 1837. On May 16, 2006 the University released their findings; the Investigative Committee unanimously concluded that Churchill had engaged in \"serious research misconduct\", including falsification, fabrication, and two of the three allegations of plagiarism. The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions. The Standing Committee on Research Misconduct accepted the findings of the Investigative Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed. Churchill's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University's Privilege and Tenure Committee, which found that two of the seven findings of misconduct did not constitute dismissible offenses. Three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year's suspension without pay, while two favored dismissal. On July 24, 2007, the University regents voted seven to two to uphold all seven of the findings of research misconduct, overruling the recommendation of Privilege and Tenure panel that two be dismissed. By a vote of eight to one, the regents determined to fire Churchill. The next day, Churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views. The jury in Churchill's suit for reinstatement weighed the university's claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case.

The mountain was named in honor of a Colorado statesman, Samuel Hitt Elbert, who was active in the formative period of the state and Governor of the Territory of Colorado from 1873 to 1874. Henry W. Stuckle of the Hayden Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak, in 1874. The easiest and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A+ in mountaineering parlance. Mount Elbert is therefore often referred to as the \"gentle giant\" that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains. Mount Elbert is visible to the southwest of Leadville, often snow-capped even in the summer. Many other fourteeners surround Elbert in all directions, and it is very close to central Colorado's Collegiate Peaks. The neighboring Mount Massive, to the north, is the second-highest peak in the Rocky Mountains and the third-highest in the contiguous United States, and La Plata Peak, to the south, is the fifth-highest in the Rockies. The community of Twin Lakes lies at the base of Mount Elbert, Denver is about to the east, Vail is to the north, and Aspen is to the west. Leadville, about to the northeast, is the nearest large town. Elbert's parent peak is Mount Whitney in California. Including Alaska and Hawaii, Mount Elbert is the fourteenth-highest mountain in the United States.

He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275\u201376. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276. By 1277, at least one Burmese vassal state named \"Gold Teeth\" (modern Yingjiang) had submitted to the Mongols. Like in 1272, the Burmese government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state; but unlike in 1272, the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there. Though it was ultimately under Mongol command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were Turkic-speaking peoples or people from the further west: Turks from Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv and Nishapur, but also captive soldiers from the Khwarazmid empire, the Kipchaks, and even Bulgars from the lower Volga.

But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in 1300\u201301. Marco Polo reported the first invasions (1277\u201387) in his travelogue, Il Milione. The Burmese referred to the invaders as the Taruk (after the central Asian Turkic troops that largely made up the Mongol invasion army); today, the term Taruk () refers to the Han Chinese instead. King Narathihapate is unkindly remembered in Burmese history as Taruk-Pye Min, (\"the King who Fled from the Taruk\"). In the 13th century, the Pagan Empire, along with the Khmer Empire, was one of the two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia. For much of its history, Pagan's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent Dali Kingdom and its predecessor Nanzhao, both with Dali as their capital city. Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west and at other times with China's Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself. Between the newly conquered Mongol territory and Pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan as well as the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges. The Mongol Empire first arrived at the doorstep of the Pagan Empire in 1252 by invading the Dali Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China. The Mongol armies captured the capital, Dali, on 7 January 1253, and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by 1257.

He was a cunning and ruthless tactician, who had risen to power through a combination of bravery, cunning, and luck. Thein Ko saw the Mongols as a threat to his own ambitions, and set out to unite the warring factions against the foreign invaders.\n\nHowever, not all of the warlords were willing to follow Thein Ko's lead. Some saw him as a power-hungry upstart, and preferred to maintain their independence. Others, disillusioned with the chaos and destruction that had engulfed their world, began to seek out a new leader who could bring peace and stability to the region.

They sent spies and scouts to infiltrate the city-states and gather intelligence, and their military leaders began to quietly mobilize their armies, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, a group of charismatic leaders emerged, claiming to possess the power to bring order and stability back to the region. These warlords and chieftains, many of whom were veterans of the Pagan wars, promised their followers security and prosperity in exchange for their loyalty.\n\nOne such leader was a mysterious woman named Hwang Hong Mai, who claimed to possess mystical abilities and a vision for a new empire that would surpass the Pagan Empire's greatness. She rallied a vast following and carved out a vast territory for herself, using her charisma and martial skills to defeat rival claimants.\n\nBut Hwang Hong Mai's rise to power was watched with great interest by the Mongols, who saw her as a potential pawn in their game of empire-building.

{"prefix": "In examining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German government has noted that Scientology organizations are \"structured so as to make the individual psychologically and financially dependent on a Scientology system\", and that members often abandon contact with friends and family. Scientology first became active in Germany in 1970.", "gold": "By 2007, there were ten major centres (\"Scientology Churches\"), as well as fourteen minor centres (\"Scientology Missions\") in Germany. The German Scientology Churches are located in the big cities \u2013 Munich, Hamburg, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, Hannover and Stuttgart. Of the Scientology Missions, nine are in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and three in Bavaria. Following German re-unification, Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic; most adherents are found in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia. Scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or Vereine in Germany; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000. The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred. Scientology formulated a \"Clear Germany\" strategy in 1994 \u2013 similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world \u2013 with the long-term aim of transforming German society in line with the Scientological ideal: a non-pluralist society in which Scientology enjoys overriding influence.", "text1": "The German government's concerns about Scientology's influence on individuals and society have only intensified over the years. In 1997, the government banned Scientology's \"Church of Scientology\" and its affiliated organizations, citing their cult-like behavior and the organization's attempt to infiltrate and manipulate German society. However, Scientology appealed the decision and was ultimately allowed to continue operating in Germany.\n\nDespite this, the German government has continued to monitor Scientology's activities closely, and has taken steps to educate the public about the potential risks of getting involved with the organization. In 2019, the government launched a public awareness campaign, warning citizens about the dangers of Scientology's recruitment tactics and the organization's goal of converting people into lifelong followers.\n\nGerman law enforcement agencies have also been actively working to counter Scientology's activities, conducting raids on the organization's facilities and arresting high-ranking members who have been accused of fraud, extortion, and other crimes. In 2020, several top officials of the Scientology organization in Germany were arrested and charged with fraud and embezzlement, sparking widespread criticism of the organization's practices.\n\nDespite these efforts, Scientology remains a significant concern for the German government, which continues to worry about the organization's ability to attract new members and exert influence over individuals and society. As such, the government has pledged to continue monitoring Scientology's activities closely and to take action to protect citizens from the organization's potentially harmful practices.", "text2": "Since then, the organization has been steadily expanding its operations, establishing branches in major cities across the country, including Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich.

The organization's use of charismatic leaders and elaborate ceremonies has been cited as a key factor in its ability to lure in new recruits, many of whom have reported significant changes to their personal and social lives once they join.\n\nCultivation of allegiance is a key aspect of Scientology, with adherents often encouraged to purchase expensive training materials, attend lengthy seminars, and undergo intense auditing rituals. German authorities have noted that many former Scientologists have reported difficulties in leaving the organization, due in part to the use of guilt, shame, and emotional manipulation by church leaders.\n\nMoves have been made to restrict Scientology's activity in Germany, including a ban imposed in the 1980s on the organization's use of the term \"church\". Despite these measures, many continue to view Scientology as a threat to religious freedom and individual rights, and calls for greater government action have grown louder.", "text3": "The organization has been consistently growing and opening branches in key cities throughout the country, such as Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich.

Encouraging loyalty is a fundamental element of Scientology, with followers frequently urged to buy costly training materials, participate in lengthy seminars, and engage in rigorous auditing rituals. German authorities have observed that numerous ex-Scientologists have faced challenges when trying to exit the group, partly because of the guilt, shame, and emotional manipulation employed by church leaders.

{"prefix": "Ohshima stated that \"Sonic\" was chosen because it represented speed. Ideas proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band, giving him vampire fangs, and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna, but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple.", "gold": "Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a hedgehog is and initially proposed a full-scale recreation of the character, but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes. The antagonist ended up being named \"Dr. Eggman\" in Japan and \"Dr. Robotnik\" in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega's American and Japanese divisions. With a satisfying protagonist completed, Sega turned to programmer Yuji Naka, who had impressed them through his work on Phantasy Star and the Genesis port of Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Naka was a fan of Super Mario Bros. but desired something faster, so the game was made to play quickly, which was where he focused most of his effort. Naka explained that the reason he wanted a fast game was that he had ported Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and wanted to work on its movement but found it slow. Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by a team of seven: two programmers, two sound engineers, and three designers, although it began with just Naka and Ohshima. People came onto the team as the need for content increased. After being assigned a project with the code name \"Defeat Mario\", Naka and Ohshima began work, but encountered problems: Ohshima's Rabbit proved hard to program. Catching items and throwing them caused the action's rhythm to break. Naka stated that the rabbit was not suitable for his game engine, and he also wanted the game to be playable with only one button. Hirokazu Yasuhara came onto the team to supervise Naka and Ohshima and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping. The trio came up with the idea of him rolling into a ball. After the hedgehog character was chosen, many characters were redrawn, and the team agreed on the environments' visual complexity, with particular focus on the colors. After this, four people came onto the team to speed development up. Due to the popularity of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic to take over the American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent.", "text1": "The development team, led by Yuji Naka, was divided on the direction of the game's story and characters. While some members thought Sonic's speed was enough to carry the game, others believed he needed a compelling narrative and character traits to make him relatable to players.\n\nNaoto Ohshima, the game's original character designer, continued to push for more depth in Sonic's character. He envisioned Sonic as a rebellious teenager who defies authority and takes on the evil scientist, Dr. Eggman. This would give Sonic a sense of purpose and motivation, beyond just running fast.\n\nHowever, the team's producer, Hayao Nakayama, was skeptical of this direction. He believed that a simple, fast-paced gameplay experience would be enough to appeal to players, and that adding too much complexity would detract from the game's core appeal.\n\nAs the debate continued, Sonic's design underwent several changes. His initial concept art depicted a more humanoid character with a rounded body and arms, but Naka and Ohshima eventually settled on a more cartoonish, blue-furred animal with a hedgehog's spikes.\n\nMeanwhile, the story and characters of the game began to take shape. Dr. Eggman, a brilliant but mad scientist, was introduced as the main antagonist, seeking to conquer the world using his robotic creations. Sonic, determined to stop him, embarked on a quest to gather the Chaos Emeralds, which would give him the power to defeat Dr. Eggman.\n\nAs the game's development progressed, the team's vision for Sonic began to solidify. He would be a lovable, energetic hero who embodied the spirit of freedom and rebellion. The game's tagline, \"Gotta go fast!\", became a rallying cry for the development team, and Sonic's iconic blue spikes and red shoes became synonymous with speed and adventure.", "text2": "As the debate over Sonic's character continued, Sega of Japan and Sega of America found themselves at a crossroads. While Oshima's vision of Sonic as a fast-moving hero had resonated with many, the team was struggling to agree on his personality and backstory.\n\nYuuji Naka, the lead designer of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, pushed for a more lighthearted and humorous approach to the character. \"Sonic isn't just about speed,\" he argued. \"He's a lovable, mischievous hedgehog who loves to play pranks and cause trouble.\"\n\nHowever, other team members, such as Naoto Ohshima, were adamant that Sonic needed a more serious, brooding persona to resonate with players. \"Sonic is a hero, not a clown,\" he insisted. \"He needs to be tough and determined if we want to win over gamers worldwide.\"\n\nThe disagreement was put on the back burner for now, but the debate would continue as the team refined the character and prepared him for his big debut.\n\nMeanwhile, the team was facing another issue: the lack of an iconic nemesis for Sonic. \"We can't just have Sonic racing around without someone to challenge him,\" said Naka. \"We need a villain who can push him to be his best and keep him from becoming too bored with his surroundings.\"\n\nThe team tossed around ideas, from a mad scientist bent on world domination to a rival sports figure hell-bent on outperforming Sonic. Ultimately, they settled on Doctor Eggman (also known as Dr. Robotnik), a brilliant but eccentric scientist with a penchant for elaborate schemes and a thirst for power.\n\nBut how would this villainous new character fit into Sonic's world?

The team was having difficulty reaching a consensus on Sonic's personality and backstory, despite the widespread appeal of Oshima's idea of him as a speedy hero. Yuuji Naka advocated for a lighter and more comedic portrayal of the Sonic character. He contended that Sonic's character goes beyond just being fast. He is an endearing hedgehog who enjoys pulling pranks and causing mischief. On the other hand, Naoto Ohshima and some team members believed that Sonic should have a darker and more introspective personality to connect with players. He emphasized that Sonic should be seen as a hero, not a comedic character. In order to capture the attention of gamers globally, he must exhibit resilience and unwavering resolve. The team temporarily set aside their differences on Sonic's character, but the ongoing discussion would persist as they worked on developing him for his upcoming introduction. At the same time, the team encountered a problem with the absence of a memorable adversary for Sonic. Naka emphasized the importance of having a worthy opponent for Sonic to face in his adventures. It is essential to have an antagonist who can challenge Sonic and prevent him from getting complacent. The team considered various concepts, ranging from a villainous scientist seeking global control to a competitive athlete determined to surpass Sonic. In the end, they chose Doctor Eggman (or Dr. Robotnik), a clever scientist with grand plans and a desire for control. How would this new villain integrate into Sonic's universe?

He was buried in Ashland, Ohio. The secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days. At the time, Punch stated that Richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident, though it is unlikely that Richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months. Ten days after his death, on August 23, the Richmond family held a press conference to reveal that Richmond died from complications from AIDS, which he acquired from an unknown woman. Richmond's physician, Dr. David Dodson, said: \"There's no way of knowing who that woman was. Tim was a celebrity with a lot of charisma, a handsome guy. He naturally attracted a lot of women.\" Punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and personnel underwent HIV testing in the wake of Richmond's death. In 1990, a few months after Richmond's death, Washington television station WJLA-TV and reporter Roberta Baskin reported that Dr. Forest Tennant, who was then the National Football League's drug adviser, \"falsified drug tests\" that ultimately helped shorten Richmond's NASCAR career. Baskin reported that sealed court documents and interviews showed Tennant and NASCAR used \"allegedly false drug-test results in 1988 to bar Richmond from racing\". Baskin also stated that NASCAR had targeted Richmond, requesting that Tennant establish a substance-abuse policy with Richmond in mind. A series of drug tests and falsely reported positive results shortly before the 1988 Daytona 500 kept Richmond from driving in what was to have been his last big race...\", the report said. The New York Times published the findings. While neither Tennant nor NASCAR supplied an official response at the time, NASCAR did confirm that they were seeking to replace Tennant.

However, as Nosek fell sick after the concert, they called him an ambulance. According to Jebav\u00fd, the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it. Nosek's other friend Ond\u0159ej Vlach testified that Nosek's fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge at the back of his head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage. Another person to testify was Robert Havelka, who worked as a security guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely. Blythe's defense team attacked differences between the testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court. Among other things, one of the witnesses originally alleged that Nosek and Blythe shook hands or that one of them offered hand to another on stage; however, at the court hearing, he testified that there was no prior contact between them.

It is evident that Blythe was justified in being concerned for her safety that night, given the history of death threats and harassment she has faced from fans in the past. I want to point out that Nosek's testimony is inconsistent with his initial statement to the police, where he said Blythe attacked him without provocation.

In 1906, Gauthier was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour. Albani provided a degree of mentorship to Gauthier during the 30-week tour of Canada. Lord Strathcona awarded Gauthier a scholarship in 1906 that allowed her to return to Europe and continue her vocal studies. She returned there and continued both to study and give performances. Her first operatic performance came in 1909 in Pavia, Italy as Mica\u00ebla in Bizet's Carmen. She landed a second operatic role as Mallika in Delibes' Lakm\u00e9, which was being performed by the London Covent Garden opera company. The opera opened in June 1910. Supposedly, Luisa Tetrazzini, the prima donna soprano of the company, feared that Gauthier's voice would outshine her own, and demanded that Gauthier be removed from the opera. The company's director acquiesced to Tetrazzini's demands, informing Gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing. Rather than give in to artistic blackmail, Gauthier quit opera entirely. Disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene, Gauthier departed Europe and travelled to Java. There, she met a Dutch importer and plantation manager named Frans Knoote. Gauthier and Knoote married on May 22, 1911.

Her accompanying pianist was Paul Seelig, who had previously been the conductor for the Kraton of Surakarta, which afforded Gauthier a number of opportunities. On permission of the Javanese court, she studied the gamelan, probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity. While living in Java, Gauthier travelled extensively, giving performances in China, Japan, Singapore, Malaya, Australia, and New Zealand. She remained in Java for four years, but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America, arriving in New York City in the fall of 1914.

Through the UP, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US 2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin. The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the UPDB. A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle Tours by seventy years, the route followed \"a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ...\" This route followed the modern US 2 from Ironwood to the M\u201194 junction in Manistique, using the modern M\u201169 and M\u201195 to stay in Michigan. Branches of the route followed US 41 and M\u201135 between Powers and Escanaba. The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan. The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well. In 1920, the King's International Highway linked Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the Trans-Canada Highway name. The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was M\u201112, a designation that was in use by July 1, 1919, between Ironwood and Sault Ste. Marie.", "text1": "As BL I-75 enters the heart of St. Ignace, the quaint shops and restaurants along the waterfront offer a charming respite from the hustle and bustle of modern transportation.

In fact, the Native American tribes that once inhabited this region, such as the Odawa and Ojibwe, relied heavily on these waterways and trails to travel and trade. The French explorers and missionaries who followed soon after, including Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet, used these same routes to chart the region's vast wilderness. Today, visitors can still follow in their footsteps by hiking the North Country Trail, which passes through St. Ignace and offers breathtaking views of the lake and surrounding islands.

Meanwhile, using tractors to drag the tanks through the mud, the Australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16:00 on 20 May the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river, unbeknown to the Japanese. The following day, the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective, which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing, and further delayed by stiff resistance. Later, after one of the battalion's patrols came under heavy fire, the tanks moved up and attacked a Japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned, leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition. By 22 May, although there were still a number of Japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications, most of the Australian objectives had been secured and mopping up operations began. The last remaining defensive location before the Hongorai was Egan's Ridge, where the Japanese were sheltering in tunnels. A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge. It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry. Within a short period of time the Buin Road was subsequently opened, providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign, being the advance to the Hari, Mobiai, and Mivo Rivers. The final phase of the battle cost the Japanese 106 killed, while the Australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded. During the course of the fighting around the Hongorai, the Australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded, while the Japanese lost at least 275 men killed.

{"prefix": "Mycena maculata bears some resemblance to M. inclinata, but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and is found in eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M. inclinata.", "gold": "M. inclinata is often confused with the edible M. galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M. galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins. M. polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish-gray. Mycena inclinata is a saprobic fungus, deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches. It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The fruit bodies of Mycena inclinata grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps (especially oak and chestnut) during the spring and autumn. The fungus forms a white, woolly mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves. Occasionally, it can be found growing on a living tree. In eastern North America, it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, Missouri, North Carolina, and New York. It has been found in Oregon, but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast. The range of the fungus also includes Europe, the Canary Islands, North Africa, East Siberia, Japan, Malesia, Turkey, and New Zealand. In a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in Ordu (Turkey), M. inclinata was found to have comparatively high levels of iron (628 mg per kg) and nickel (21.6 mg/kg), measured on a dry weight basis. Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum. The fungus has been investigated for its ability to decolorize synthetic dyes that are used in the textile, plastics, biomedical and foodstuff industries. The dyes are not readily biodegradable, and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic.", "text1": "The reddish spots on the gills of Mycena maculata are a distinguishing feature of the species, and are thought to be a result of the breakdown of the wood's lignin by enzymes produced by the fungus. This unique characteristic has led some researchers to suggest that Mycena maculata may play a key role in the decomposition process of hardwood logs and stumps, particularly in eastern North America.\n\nIn addition to its distinctive gill markings, Mycena maculata can be recognized by its small to medium-sized cap, which is typically 1-3 cm in diameter, and its slender stalk. The cap is usually white to cream-colored, with a slightly wavy edge, and is covered in small, fine hairs. The gills are narrow and run down the length of the stalk, and are initially white but turn pinkish-gray as the fruiting body matures.\n\nMycena maculata is a saprotrophic species, meaning it obtains its nutrients by breaking down and decomposing organic matter. It is thought to be an important part of the ecosystem, helping to recycle nutrients and break down complex organic molecules into simpler compounds that can be used by other organisms.\n\nIn addition to its ecological importance, Mycena maculata has also been studied for its potential medicinal properties.

In his message to the legislature in 1904, Beckham again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law, which had not passed during his first term. The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session. Also during the session, funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor Goebel. In March 1904, Beckham signed the Day Law, mandating racial segregation of all schools in Kentucky.

Again, only Harlan dissented. Near the close of the 1904 session, legislators approved the creation of Beckham County from parts of Carter, Elliott, and Lewis Counties. Olive Hill was made the county seat. Soon, the county's existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties from which it was carved to less than . Carter County joined the lawsuit, claiming the border of Beckham County passed too close to Grayson, the seat of Carter County, and to Vanceburg, the seat of Lewis County. The state constitution forbade county borders from passing within of a county seat. On April 29, 1904, the Kentucky Court of Appeals found in favor of the plaintiffs and dissolved Beckham County.

Beckham's defeat marked the end of his political career, and he returned to his family's tobacco farm in central Kentucky, where he lived out the rest of his life.\n\nIn the years that followed, Beckham's legacy as governor was reevaluated by historians, who noted that while he had passed some important legislation, his attempts to circumvent the constitutional ban on consecutive terms had damaged his reputation and led to his downfall.

When James Scott, a publican, subsequently joined the partnership, the three men decided that Warbrick would be the team's captain, Scott its manager and Eyton its promoter. Warbrick started assembling a team for the tour in early 1888. He had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability, and failed to secure the talented Jack Taiaroa due to his university commitments. Some M\u0101ori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part-M\u0101ori. Twenty M\u0101ori or part-M\u0101ori players joined the squad; five P\u0101keh\u0101 (white New Zealand) players were added after the team lost to Auckland. Due to the inclusion of these P\u0101keh\u0101 players the team was renamed from the \"New Zealand Maori\" to the \"New Zealand Native Football Representatives\". The final squad comprised 26 players (including Warbrick); of these at least five were full-blooded M\u0101ori, while fourteen had a M\u0101ori mother and a P\u0101keh\u0101 father. The parentage of some of the players is unknown.

Their last New Zealand match before departure, against Otago played in Dunedin on 31 July 1888, was won by one try to nil. The team sailed for Australia from Dunedin, leaving on 1 August 1888. In Melbourne, Scott recruited Jack Lawlor to train the players in Victorian Rules football in Britain as preparation for possible Victorian Rules matches on their return to Australia. The team played two rugby matches against the Melbourne Rugby Union team, winning the first and drawing the second, before continuing to Britain via Suez. They arrived in London on 27 September 1888.

{"prefix": "In 2005, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4.1 of the German Constitution, which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate. Many courts have declined to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand.", "gold": "The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion. Recent years have seen a number of court decisions in Scientology's favour, despite the very widespread negative attitude to Scientology among politicians and the general public. Given the history of Nazism's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s, the present German state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution. The BfV domestic intelligence service (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany's free and democratic order, and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997, as have the Offices for the Protection of the Constitution in a number of German L\u00e4nder. Minister for Family Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance, saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal. The German Church of Scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court. In December 2001, the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the Church of Scientology Berlin as paid informants. The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution. At the federal level, Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti-Scientology legislation.", "text1": "Despite this decision, the controversy surrounding Scientology's status as a religion continued to unfold. In 2011, the German government introduced a law that designated Scientology as a \"sect\" rather than a religion, allowing for increased government oversight and regulation of the organization. This move was met with widespread criticism from human rights organizations and religious freedom advocates, who argued that the government was unfairly targeting a particular religious group.\n\nIn response to the controversy, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) weighed in on the issue in 2017. In a landmark ruling, the ECHR declared that Scientology was indeed a religion and that Germany's treatment of the organization had violated its human rights obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. The court found that Germany had failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify its treatment of Scientology and that the organization had a legitimate right to freedom of religion and association.\n\nThe ECHR's decision was seen as a significant victory for Scientology and its members, who had long argued that they were being unfairly targeted by the German government. However, the ruling also highlighted the complex and often contentious issue of religious freedom in modern society, and the challenges that governments face in balancing competing interests and values. As the debate surrounding Scientology's status as a religion continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how governments will respond to the demands of religious freedom and the concerns of citizens who may view certain religions as potentially harmful or dangerous.", "text2": "This decision was seen as a significant victory for Scientology, which had long been criticized by some German politicians and media outlets as a \"business cult\" rather than a religion. However, the court's ruling was widely viewed as a strong defense of the principle of religious freedom in Germany.\n\nFollowing this court decision, the German Interior Ministry announced that it would no longer systematically target Scientology as an \"enemy of the state\" or pursue criminal investigations against its members, as it had done in the past. Instead, the government would focus on ensuring that all religious groups, including Scientology, adhered to the country's laws and regulations.\n\nAdditionally, the court's decision led to increased cooperation between the Church of Scientology and German authorities, with the organization's representatives meeting with government officials to discuss the organization's role in German society and to address concerns about its practices. These efforts helped to ease tensions between the Church of Scientology and the government, and laid the groundwork for a more constructive dialogue between the two.\n\nOver time, the Church of Scientology has continued to expand its presence in Germany, with the organization opening new centers and attracting more adherents. While some opposition to the Church remains, the court's decision in 2005 is seen as a key factor in establishing Scientology as a recognized religious organization in Germany, and as a milestone in the Church's efforts to establish a more permanent presence in the country.", "text3": "The decision was considered a major win for Scientology, which had faced criticism in Germany for being labeled a \"business cult\" instead of a religion. The court's decision was seen as a significant support for religious freedom in Germany. After the court ruling, the German Interior Ministry stated that it would no longer target Scientology or conduct criminal investigations against its members. The government's focus would shift to ensuring that all religious groups, including Scientology, followed the laws and regulations of the country. Furthermore, the court ruling resulted in closer collaboration between the Church of Scientology and German authorities, as representatives from the organization engaged in discussions with government officials regarding their role in German society and addressing any concerns about their practices. These actions facilitated improved relations between the Church of Scientology and the government, setting the stage for a more positive conversation between them.

{"prefix": "As a result, he was able to produce some of China's first printed publications in colour, using a block printing technique known as \"assorted block printing\" (douban yinshua, ). This system made use of multiple blocks, each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour.", "gold": "It was a lengthy, painstaking process, requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image. Hu also employed a related form of multiple-block printing called \"set-block printing\" (taoban yinshua, ), which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again. He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing; this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible. In some images, Hu employed a blind embossing technique (known as \"embossed designs\" (gonghua, ) or \"embossed blocks\" (gongban, ), using an uninked, imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper. He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants. This was a relatively new process, having been invented by Hu's contemporary Wu Faxiang, who was also a Nanjing-based publisher. Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book Wisteria Studio Letter Paper (Luoxuan Biangu Jianpu, ), published in 1626. Both Hu and Wu used embossing to create decorative writing papers, the sale of which provided a sideline income for the Ten Bamboo Studio. [[File:Hu Zhengyan - Bamboo in snow 1.PNG|thumbnail|Bamboo in snow from the 'Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy]] Hu's most notable work is the Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy (Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu, ), an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well as a collection of artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting.", "text1": "With this innovative technique, Wang Zhen was able to create stunningly colorful publications that captivated the eyes of readers in 14th-century China. His most famous work, a set of Buddhist scriptures, featured intricate illustrations of Bodhisattvas and sacred landscapes, rendered in a range of vibrant hues that seemed to leap off the page. The beauty and precision of these color prints were a far cry from the crude, monochromatic block prints that had dominated the medium until then.\n\nAs news of Wang Zhen's achievements spread, scholars and artists from across the country flocked to his studio in Nanjing, eager to learn the secrets of his art. Among them was a young apprentice named Wu Wei, who would go on to become a master printer in his own right. Under Wang Zhen's guidance, Wu Wei honed his skills in the assorted block printing technique, eventually creating his own masterpieces that rivaled those of his mentor.\n\nWang Zhen's contributions to the art of block printing did not go unnoticed by the imperial court. In 1387, the Ming dynasty's ruling Emperor Hongwu himself commissioned Wang Zhen to create a set of color prints commemorating the imperial family.

The Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated the Club's relatively-obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. Flem D.

On April 1, 1842, some soldiers of Fort Wayne left their fort and on April 22 arrived where Fort Scott would be built, in the Osage Cuestas section of modern-day Kansas.", "gold": "After haggling with the Cherokees to acquire the land, the rest of Fort Wayne's garrison left the fort on May 26 and arrived at the Fort Scott site on May 30. Unlike most forts for military use, the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built; the wide-open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary. The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men, animals, and equipment. These buildings were on the edges of a parade ground. The post quartermaster, Captain Thomas Swords, was in charge of building Fort Scott's structures, and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie, which had few trees. He had only two bricklayers and three carpenters to rely on, as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform. Wood was available, but the mill was built away, making transport time consuming. Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood, skilled labor and working equipment. Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort's construction. As a result, only one duplex of the five planned officers quarters (four duplexes and post commandant's house) was built by 1844, and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed. In his 1844 inspection of the fort, Colonel George Croghan reported that, in comparison to other frontier forts, he considered Fort Scott \"above average\". Due to the rising tensions that escalated in the Mexican\u2013American War, the US Army redeployed troops to the Southwest. With Fort Scott still uncompleted, officials decided on April 25, 1850, that no more construction would be done there, after eight years and $35,000. By the time it was finished, it was obsolete; three years later, it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western Fort Riley. For the average soldier, life at the fort was \"monotonous\". Until the permanent structures were built, soldiers had to live in tents, which lacked comfort. Aside from a few whiskey peddlers and prostitutes, few civilians lived at the fort. Officers had brought their personal slaves with them, including Captain Swords. The border with Missouri was east of Fort Scott. In Missouri was a grog shop that supplied soldiers, and quite a few courts-martial followed soldiers' going AWOL at the shop.", "text1": "Upon arriving at the site, the soldiers found a group of Osage Indians already present, who were reportedly surprised to see the military presence. The soldiers, led by Captain Lyon, began to build a fort to establish a stronger military presence in the area and to deter further raids by the Osage. Over the next few weeks, the fort was constructed using wood and earth, with a stockade made of cedar trees to protect against potential attacks.\n\nAs the fort took shape, Captain Lyon and his men began to interact with the local Osage tribe, trying to establish a sense of peace and understanding. However, tensions remained high, and the Osage continued to be wary of the growing military presence. In response, the Army sent out envoys to meet with the Osage leaders, hoping to negotiate a treaty and put an end to the raids.\n\nOne of these envoys, a trader named John Dougherty, managed to meet with the Osage leader, Chief George Washington Howe, and began to discuss the terms of a potential treaty. After several days of negotiations, a treaty was agreed upon, which would establish a peace between the Army and the Osage, as well as provide for the safe passage of white settlers through Osage territory.\n\nWith the treaty in place, the fort was officially named Fort Scott, in honor of General Winfield Scott, the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army.

In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution. At the federal level, Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.

Beckham voted against it both times. The Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas that those industries were prominent, Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women's vote and by his support of Wilson, who had lost popularity since Beckham's election, in 1914. Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3% of the vote to Beckham's 49.7&%. During his only term in the Senate, Beckham served alongside three other US Senators from Kentucky: Ollie M. James, George B. Martin, and Augustus O. Stanley. After his term in the Senate ended, Beckham resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time, he had the support of the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful political machine, known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks. The Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated the Club's relatively-obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. Flem D. Sampson, the Club's nominee in the Republican primary, won his party's nomination. In the general election, Beckham could not secure the support of Democratic Governor William J. Fields, who had been elected with the help of the Jockey Club. Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, Beckham lost to Sampson by more than 32,000 votes, with voting fraud suspected but never proved. It was estimated that the Club spent over $500,000 to defeat him. Beckham was expected to be the Democrats' nominee for governor in 1935, but the death of his son in late 1934 had left him distraught, and his wife was opposed to another campaign. The Democrats turned to A. B. \"Happy\" Chandler, of Henderson, who won the election.

The amendment's passage had been a hard-won victory for the women's suffrage movement, and many Tennesseans felt that Beckham's stance was a betrayal of the state's progressive reputation. In response to the backlash, Beckham attempted to justify his position by arguing that women were not yet prepared to participate in the political process, citing concerns about their ability to make informed decisions and their potential susceptibility to manipulation by unscrupulous politicians. However, his words only seemed to alienate him further from his constituents, and he began to feel the heat of public opinion bearing down on him.

She received numerous letters and messages from women across the country, urging her to reconsider her stance. However, Beckham remained steadfast in her opposition, believing that women were too emotional and easily swayed by sentimental issues to be entrusted with the serious responsibility of voting.\n\nMeanwhile, the women's suffrage movement, led by figures like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, hailed the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment as a major triumph and a testament to the power of grassroots activism. They saw Beckham's opposition as a stark reminder of the struggles still to come, and they vowed to continue fighting for equal rights and representation in government.\n\nBeckham's views, while they sparked heated debate and controversy, ultimately had little impact on the broader course of the women's suffrage movement. The amendment had been ratified, and women across the country were now empowered to exercise their right to vote.

Many of the people Beckham represented in Kentucky supported the amendment and were angry at her for opposing it. Women from all over the country reached out to her, asking her to reconsider her position. Despite the pressure and pleas from women across the country, Beckham continued to oppose the amendment, citing her belief that women were not capable of making rational decisions when it came to voting. The Nineteenth Amendment's passage was celebrated by leaders of the women's suffrage movement as a significant victory achieved through grassroots activism. They viewed Beckham's resistance as a clear indication of the ongoing challenges and committed to persisting in the battle for equal rights and political representation. Despite causing controversy, Beckham's opinions did not significantly affect the overall trajectory of the women's suffrage movement.

Waldman felt that \"TNA put on a strong PPV\" that was in \"large part to little gimmickery.\" Regarding the main event, Waldman gave it a 6 out of 10, while the World Tag Team Championship match received a 4 out of 10. He gave the Six Woman Tag Team match a 4.5 out of 10 and the A.J. Styles versus Kurt Angle bout a 9 out of 10. The X Division Championship contest was given a 7 out of 10. Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter reviewed the show. He felt the main event had \"lots of action and drama,\" but that having to hang the belt on a hook does not make for a \"particularly dramatic end to a match as it seems like someone hanging a plant in the corner\" than \"beating someone to win a fight.\" Keller said the World Tag Team Championship contest was a \"solid tag match\" with some \"elaborate sequences\" that were \"well executed.\" Keller stated that the X Division Championship match was a \"very good opener.\" Regarding the Styles and Angle bout, Keller commented that it was a \"good match, but short of a classic must-see match in part because there were too many chinlocks mid-match from Angle that took the crowd out of it.\"", "text1": "But Nash, still reeling from the sudden attack, managed to grab onto the title belt and hold on tight, preventing Booker T from hanging him.

Beckham refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars.", "gold": "He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably, his reasons were political. The Democrats were dominant in the region, and he wanted to avoid challenging his own party. By collecting some old US Civil War debts from the federal government, Beckham also virtually eliminated the state's debt. Encouraged by the state's improved finances, the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state's normal schools: Western State Teachers College in Bowling Green (later Western Kentucky University) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond (later part of Eastern Kentucky University). With a successful legislative session behind him, Beckham made a bold political move in June 1906. He orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November, a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. Beckham wanted the Senate seat, and if the primary was moved up two years, he could secure his party's nomination while he was still governor. He could also use his influence as governor to sway the party's choice of his potential successor as governor. State Auditor Samuel Wilbur Hager was Beckham's choice for governor and easily won the early primary over challenger N.B. Hays. Former Governor James B. McCreary challenged Beckham for the senatorial nomination, but Beckham won by more than 11,000 votes. Beckham's term as governor ended on December 10, 1907. In January 1908, he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the US Senate by virtue of the primary that had been held two years earlier. The Republicans nominated former Governor William O. Bradley. On the first ballot, Beckham secured 66 of the needed 69 votes; Bradley received 64 votes. Seven Democrats had not voted for Beckham. Over the next six weeks, 25 more votes were taken, with neither man securing a majority, even though William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee for president, campaigned for Beckham. Some Democrats pressured Beckham to withdraw and to allow a more palatable Democrat to run, but he refused. On the 29th ballot, taken near the end of February 1908, Bradley finally secured a majority, after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him. Beckham's ardent support of Prohibition likely cost him the election. That put him at odds with Henry Watterson, editor of the powerful Louisville Courier-Journal.

The Black Patch Tobacco Wars, which had been ongoing for months, showed no signs of abating. The violence had already claimed numerous lives, and the situation was escalating by the day. Beckham's refusal to send in troops was met with outrage from many Kentuckians, who felt that the governor was not taking adequate action to protect their safety.\n\nMeanwhile, the insurance reform bill was gaining traction in the legislature. Beckham's proposal to require insurance companies to invest a percentage of their earnings in the state was seen as a bold move to stimulate the local economy. Many argued that the bill would not only benefit policyholders by providing more protections against fraud, but also help to create jobs and boost economic growth.\n\nHowever, not everyone was convinced. Some opponents of the bill argued that it was an overreach of government power and that the market should be allowed to regulate itself. Others claimed that the proposal would stifle innovation and drive away businesses that might be attracted to the state.\n\nAs the debate continued, Beckham found himself facing increasing pressure from all sides. The Black Patch Tobacco Wars were getting worse by the day, and the governor was under fire for his handling of the situation. The insurance reform bill was also generating intense opposition, and Beckham was struggling to find a way to balance the competing interests of the state's residents.\n\nIn the end, Beckham made a bold decision. He announced that he would be sending a team of mediators to the western part of the state to try to negotiate a peace between the warring tobacco growers. He also vowed to continue to push for the insurance reform bill, despite the opposition it faced.\n\nThe move was met with both praise and criticism. Some hailed Beckham as a courageous leader who was willing to take risks to protect the people of Kentucky. Others saw him as a foolhardy politician who was trying to solve too many problems at once.\n\nAs the situation in the western part of the state continued to unfold, Beckham's administration was faced with the daunting task of trying to restore peace and stability to the region.

He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely. Blythe's defense team attacked differences between the testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court. Among other things, one of the witnesses originally alleged that Nosek and Blythe shook hands or that one of them offered hand to another on stage; however, at the court hearing, he testified that there was no prior contact between them. Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior. Milan Po\u0159\u00e1dek, the fan whom Blythe admitted to shoving off the stage, testified on the third day of the trial. Po\u0159\u00e1dek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage. Po\u0159\u00e1dek testified that Blythe knocked him down, knelt on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not choke him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he (Po\u0159\u00e1dek) was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage. Another witness who had attended the concert at the rear of the crowd testified that Blythe's behavior was standard to metal concerts, saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception. She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage. Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of Nosek's fall at the end of the concert. The judge also read a sworn statement from Abaton's former producer, who stated that she had not known about the incident. She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening, but learned about the reasons for that only later, during the police investigation. The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue, including that barriers should be placed from the stage.

I didn't think much of it at the time, but now I realize it might have been a clue to what happened next.\"\n\nAs the trial continued, the prosecution also presented evidence from the stagehands who had been setting up for the second act. They testified that they had seen Vlach lingering in the wings, seemingly waiting for something to happen. \"He was muttering to himself, and looked like he was in a trance,\" one of the stagehands recalled. \"We didn't think much of it, but now I wonder if he was planning something.\"\n\nThe prosecution's case was building, but the defense was determined to poke holes in the evidence.

As a result, several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century.", "gold": "It was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the Irrawaddy basin, restoring some semblance of normalcy. The vast region surrounding the Irrawaddy valley would continue to be made up of several small Tai-Shan states well into the 16th century. Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the Mongol invasions was the emergence of Tai-Shan states in mainland Southeast Asia. The Tai-Shan people who came down with the Mongol invasions stayed. By the early 14th century, several Tai-Shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present-day Assam to northern and eastern Myanmar to northern and central Thailand and Laos. Their rise was encouraged by the Mongols, who viewed the states as a useful buffer between Yunnan and the rest of Southeast Asia. The Mongols, who were still trying to incorporate Yunnan into the central administration, were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of Yunnan into the fold. (The integration of Yunnan itself into \u201cChina Proper\u201d was to take several more centuries, and continues to today.) As such, from the newly formed Tai-Shan states in western and central Southeast Asia to Dai Viet and Champa in eastern Southeast Asia, the Mongols elected to receive nominal tribute. Though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the Yuan government, they were the native chieftains, \u201cwho would have ruled there in any case, and they did as they pleased.\u201d The war also marked the arrival of China at the doorstep of Burma. The old Dali Kingdom, known to the Burmese as Gandalarit (, after Gandhara Raj) was now a Mongol Chinese province. (The Burmese now called the new powers at Yunnan \"Taruk\" after the Turkic-speaking soldiers of Yunnan. Over the years, the term Taruk came to be used to refer to the Han Chinese. Today, King Narathihapate is remembered as Taruk-Pye Min, (\"the King who fled from the Taruk [Chinese]).) From a geopolitical standpoint, the Mongol\u2013Chinese presence in Yunnan pushed the Shan migrations in the direction of Burma (and parts of the Khmer Empire).

The rebels, who were largely unaffiliated with any particular dynasty or faction, sought to overthrow the existing order and create a more egalitarian society. However, their movement was eventually crushed by a coalition of warlords and Yuan loyalists, who saw the rebels as a threat to their own power and status.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mongols, who had long since abandoned their claims to the Chinese throne, focused their attention on defending their remaining territories in Central Asia and the Middle East. The khanates of Samarkand and Bukhara, which had once been integral parts of the Mongol Empire, continued to function as semi-autonomous states, paying homage to the Mongol khans in name only.\n\nAs the century drew to a close, the stage was set for the rise of a new dynasty, one that would unite China under a single ruler and bring a measure of stability to the region. The Ming dynasty, which would be founded by Zhu Yuanzhang, a former Buddhist monk and leader of the Red Turban Rebellion, would eventually succeed in reuniting China and establishing a new era of peace and prosperity.

The Ming armies, led by Zhu Yuanzhang, a former Buddhist monk turned warlord, were ruthless and efficient, and they quickly asserted their authority over much of the region.\n\nMeanwhile, in the north, the ethnic Mongolian leader Temur Qosu, who claimed to be the son of the last Yuan emperor, rallied a coalition of Mongolian tribes and launched a counter-attack against the Ming armies. The ensuing conflict, known as the Qosu-Temur Rebellion, raged across northern China for nearly a decade, claiming countless lives and laying waste to entire towns and cities. Despite its bravery, the rebellion was eventually crushed by the Ming, and Temur Qosu himself was killed in battle.\n\nAs the Ming dynasty consolidated its hold on China, it also began to assert its claims to the ancient territories once ruled by the Yuan.

While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle.

These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea, but were unsuccessful. On 14 May 1943 the hospital ship AHS Centaur was sunk by a Japanese submarine off Brisbane with the loss of 268 lives. Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI). Australia's role in the Pacific War declined from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there. In May 1945, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued until the end of the war. These campaigns contributed little to Japan's defeat and remain controversial. Following Japan's surrender on 15 August 1945 Australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored. Australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of Japanese personnel. 993,000 Australians enlisted during the war, while 557,000 served overseas. Casualties included 39,767 killed and another 66,553 were wounded. 20 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Australians. The demobilisation of the Australian military following the end of the Second World War was completed in 1947. Plans for post-war defence arrangements were predicated on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force. It was envisioned the Royal Australian Navy would maintain a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers, two cruisers, six destroyers, 16 others ships in commission and another 52 in reserve.

The Japanese continued to launch raids and attacks on Australian positions, and the Australians responded with a series of operations to push them back. In October 1942, the 7th and 9th Divisions launched Operation Lilliput, a major operation aimed at securing the Kokoda Track and pushing the Japanese out of the Owen Stanley Range.\n\nThe battle was fierce and brutal, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Australians eventually emerged victorious, but at a great cost. The war in New Guinea had taken a heavy toll on the country, and many Australians had lost their lives in the fighting. Despite this, the Australians remained committed to the fight, knowing that victory was the only way to ensure the country's safety and security.\n\nIn 1943, the Australians turned their attention to the Huon Peninsula, where they launched a major campaign to secure the region and push the Japanese out of the area.

These include crabs, molluscs, sea urchins, starfish and polychaete worms. The three clawed lobster species Homarus gammarus, H. americanus and Nephrops norvegicus are hosts to the three known species of the animal phylum Cycliophora; the species on H. gammarus has not been described. Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease gaffkaemia, caused by the bacterium Aerococcus viridans. Although it is frequently found in American lobsters, the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus, where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out. Homarus gammarus is traditionally \"highly esteemed\" as a foodstuff and was mentioned in \"The Crabfish\" a seventeenth century English folk song. It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh, frozen, canned or powdered. Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain \"excellent\" white meat, and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible. The exceptions are the gastric mill and the \"sand vein\" (gut). The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus, and the European species is considered to be more flavored. Lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots, although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out, to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand. In 2008, 4,386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa, of which 3,462 t (79%) was caught in the British Isles (including the Channel Islands). The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of . To protect known breeding females, lobsters caught carrying eggs are to be notched on a uropod, the inner tail flap of female lobsters of reproductive size (usually above the minimum landing size 87mm carapace length).

Despite their fearsome reputation, however, H. gammarus are also an important food source for many larger animals, including fish, birds, and other marine predators.\n\nIn addition to their nocturnal feeding habits, H. gammarus also exhibit a unique mating behavior. Males will often engage in elaborate courtship displays, using their antennae to tap out complex rhythms on the substrate in an attempt to attract females. Once a female has been successfully wooed, the pair will mate, with the male depositing his sperm sac onto the female's abdomen.\n\nAfter mating, the female will lay her eggs in a protected location, such as a hole or crevice, and then guard them until they hatch. The larvae, called zoea, will drift in the water column for several weeks before settling on the seafloor and beginning their transition to adulthood. This vulnerable stage of development is an important time for the H. gammarus, as it is subject to predation by a variety of marine animals, including fish, sea stars, and other crustaceans.\n\nDespite these challenges, the H. gammarus is a resilient species, with populations found in many areas of the continental shelf.

He immediately ran into a problem: the South Carolina troops (militia or the colonial regiments) were not on the Continental line, and thus not formally under his authority. Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions, and Rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces. Square-shaped Fort Sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall, with walls made from palmetto logs high and wide.

A hastily erected palisade of thick planks helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls. An assortment of 31 cannon, ranging from 9- and 12-pounders to a few British 18-pounders and French 26-pounders, dotted the front and rear walls. General Lee, when he had seen its unfinished state, had recommended abandoning the fort, calling it a \"slaughter pen\". President Rutledge refused, and specifically ordered Colonel Moultrie to \"obey [Lee] in everything, except in leaving Fort Sullivan\". Moultrie's delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on June 27 that he would replace Moultrie; the battle began the next day before he could do so. Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to Haddrell's Point. The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31, and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day. Moultrie noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island (now known as the Isle of Palms), just a few hundred yards from Sullivan's Island; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan's.

With the withdrawal of the Indonesian armed forces, police and government officials from East Timor, UNAMET re-established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September. On 19 October 1999, Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping force, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) was established, becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence. The hand-over of command of military operations from INTERFET to UNTAET was completed on 28 February 2000. Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1,500 and 2,000 personnel, as well as landing craft and Blackhawk helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission. During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro-Indonesian militia and on a number of occasions Indonesian forces as well, especially along the border with West Timor. Significant actions occurred in Suai, Mota'ain and at Aidabasalala in October 1999. However, with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005. Two Australians died from non-battle related causes, while a number were wounded in action. The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF's ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF's ability to mount and sustain such operations. In response, the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments.", "text1": "The multinational peacekeeping force, led by Australia, was deployed to East Timor on September 20, 1999, and worked to restore order and provide humanitarian aid to the displaced population. Despite the initial success of the peacekeepers in containing the violence, Indonesia continued to exert significant influence over the territory and resisted efforts to establish an independent East Timorese government.\n\nIn January 2000, the East Timorese people voted overwhelmingly in a UN-sponsored referendum in favor of independence from Indonesia, but the result was met with violence and resistance from pro-Indonesian elements. The violence was eventually brought under control by the peacekeepers, but not before many East Timorese were killed and thousands more were forced to flee their homes.\n\nIn May 2002, East Timor gained its independence, with Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, a former leader of the East Timorese resistance, being sworn in as the country's first president. However, the country still faced many challenges, including poverty, infrastructure development, and rebuilding efforts. Despite these challenges, East Timor has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing economy and a strong commitment to democratic governance and human rights.", "text2": "The arrival of the peacekeepers, led by Australian forces, brought a degree of stability to the region, but the scars of the violence and displacement would take years to heal. The East Timorese people, who had already suffered decades of oppression under Indonesian rule, were now faced with the challenge of rebuilding their lives and their country.\n\nInternational organizations and NGOs poured in aid and support, but the process of reconstruction was slow and difficult. Many of the country's infrastructure, including homes, schools, and healthcare facilities, had been destroyed or damaged in the violence. The economy, already weakened by years of underinvestment and poor governance, was in shambles.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations and other international actors began working with the East Timorese to establish a transitional government and lay the groundwork for eventual independence. The leaders of the East Timorese resistance movement, including Nobel laureate Jose Ramos-Horta, worked closely with international partners to develop a constitution and electoral process, with the goal of holding a referendum in 2002.\n\nOn August 30, 2002, the East Timorese people went to the polls to decide whether to accept the newly drafted constitution and formally declare independence from Indonesia. The result was a resounding \"yes\" - over 98% of the population voted to reject the offer of autonomy within Indonesia and instead opt for independence. On May 20, 2002, the country celebrated its first independence day, with Ramos-Horta being sworn in as the country's first President.

The people of East Timor, who had endured years of mistreatment under Indonesian control, now had to focus on reconstructing their lives and nation. Despite the influx of aid and support from international organizations and NGOs, the reconstruction process proved to be challenging and sluggish. A lot of the nation's infrastructure, such as houses, schools, and healthcare centers, were either destroyed or harmed during the conflict. The economy was in a state of disarray due to years of neglect and mismanagement. At the same time, the UN and other global entities collaborated with the people of East Timor to create a temporary government and set the foundation for future independence. East Timorese resistance movement leaders, such as Nobel laureate Jose Ramos-Horta, collaborated with international allies to establish a constitution and electoral system, aiming to conduct a referendum in 2002. In 2002, the people of East Timor voted on whether to approve the new constitution and officially break away from Indonesia. The majority of the population voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence, with over 98% rejecting the option of autonomy within Indonesia. Ramos-Horta was inaugurated as the inaugural President of the nation on May 20, 2002, marking its first independence day.

For \"Pellitt Chemical\", the production team found a \"perfect landscape of pipes and containers\" in Santa Fe Springs, surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility.

He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) \"in recognition of distinguished service in the Borneo Territories\" on 22 June. His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co-operation role when it finally did deploy.

He worked tirelessly to foster a culture of cooperation and coordination among the services, recognizing the importance of unity of effort in achieving common strategic objectives.\n\nHeadlam's leadership and expertise also earned him recognition within the international community, with the Australian government nominating him as a representative to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in 1962. In this capacity, he worked closely with military leaders from other SEATO member countries to develop strategies for countering the spread of communism in the region.\n\nThroughout this period, Headlam continued to demonstrate his commitment to the development of the RAAF as a modern and effective fighting force. He was a strong advocate for the procurement of new aircraft and equipment, recognizing the need for the RAAF to remain technologically advanced in order to maintain its effectiveness in the face of emerging threats.

Noted California architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of post office built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills.

The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6 km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at the northern end of Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan. General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17. An attempt to wade the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder-deep, too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition. He considered using boats to ferry the troops across, but the Americans, with timely advice from General Lee, adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position. As a result, the British and American forces faced each other across the channel, engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range. Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have \"the glory of being defeated alone.\" The attack was originally planned for June 24, but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days.

By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols. When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy. The king was furious at the demand and kept the Mongol envoys waiting for weeks. The court finally devised a compromise: the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king. Accompanying them was a Burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the Burmese king's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing. The king then promptly ordered an expedition, which retook the rebellious borderland regions in April 1272. The rebel leader A-Pi (\u1021\u1015\u102d) was brought back to Pagan. Dali relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action. At Beijing, Kublai Khan, who was preparing an invasion of Japan, decided against a war with Pagan\u2014for the time being. On 3 March 1273, he sent a 4-member delegation led by an imperial ambassador, the First Secretary to the Board Rites, to Pagan. The delegation carried a letter from the emperor. The letter says:\"If you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the All-Highest, send one of your brothers or senior ministers, to show men that all the world is linked with Us, and enter into a perpetual alliance.

Eileen Barker, a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics, has noted that \"Germany has gone further than any other Western European country in restricting the civil rights of Scientologists.\" The Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts; Caberta moved to a position within the Hamburg interior authority, where she continues her work on Scientology.

However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs stood by the instruction, citing concerns that Scientologists were seeking to infiltrate and manipulate German businesses and institutions.\n\nDespite the controversy, the instruction remained in place for over two decades, causing friction between the government and the Church of Scientology. In 2013, the instruction was officially revised, replacing the \"S\" mark with a more neutral notation indicating that the company was affiliated with Scientology.\n\nHowever, the legacy of EK 10/96 continued to shape the relationship between the government and Scientologists. Many Germans remained wary of the church, viewing it as a cult or a threat to their way of life. The controversy also contributed to the church's declining popularity in Germany, where it had once been a significant presence.\n\nToday, the EK 10/96 instruction is seen as a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of the tensions and fears that once characterized the relationship between the government and the Church of Scientology in Germany.

However, the practice of marking Scientology-related companies with the letter \"S\" has remained controversial.\n\nIn recent years, some have questioned the effectiveness of the instruction, with critics arguing that it can be used to unfairly prejudice against Scientologists and that it may even drive some companies to reject employment applications from Scientologists or others perceived to be associated with the religion.\n\nDespite this controversy, the instruction remains in place, with the government arguing that it serves to ensure transparency and informed decision-making for prospective employees.\n\nMeanwhile, the Church of Scientology has continued to lobby for changes to the instruction, with leaders calling it a \"breach of human rights\" and demanding that the government \"remove the stigma\" attached to their religion.\n\nAs tensions surrounding the instruction remain, it remains to be seen whether the government will consider revising the instruction in the coming years or continuing to uphold its existing policy.", "text3": "The instruction's introduction sparked criticism and controversy, as many believed the government was unfairly singling out and stigmatizing Scientologists.

Nevertheless, the act of labeling companies associated with Scientology with the letter \"S\" continues to be a topic of debate. Critics have raised concerns about the instruction's potential to unfairly discriminate against Scientologists and impact job opportunities for those associated with the religion. The government defends the instruction as necessary for transparency and informed decision-making, despite the ongoing controversy.

However, due to the circumstances, Blythe was not held criminally liable, and most of the blame lay with promoters and security members. The acquittal was upheld by the Prague High Court on June 5, 2013. The trial was documented in the film As the Palaces Burn, directed by Don Argott. During a concert on May 24, 2010, in the Prague club, Abaton, Blythe was involved in an incident that resulted in the death of Daniel Nosek, a 19-year-old attending fan. According to eyewitness statements cited by the Czech online daily newspaper aktu\u00e1ln\u011b.cz following Blythe's arrest, Blythe was chanting \"Come on!\" between songs, which, the newspaper stated, may have been intended to invite applause from the audience and not a direct invitation to fans. The newspaper went on to report that the fan tried to climb onstage and was thrown by the singer from the stage, falling backwards directly on his head. According to the same paper, Nosek was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, suffered serious brain trauma, fell into a coma, and died weeks later from his injuries. A report about the concert at issue released on May 26, 2010 by topzine.cz stated that \"one of the things that was unexpected was the behavior of the singer Randall Blythe, who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage.\" The article also contains pictures, one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground. Meanwhile, another report released two days after the concert by metalopolis.net alleged that \"Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an impertinent fan, who has climbed the podium several times.

The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the ADF's force structure and role, with the new government's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia's global security interests. In line with this new focus, the ADF's force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the ADF's combat effectiveness. The former-Portuguese colony of East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975, however, following years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President B.J.

The previous three weeks in which they had advanced to the Hongorai had been costly for them, however, with the Australian 24th Infantry Battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded. Against this, the Japanese had lost at least 169 killed. Following the advance to the Hongorai, there was a pause of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance. The main crossing was planned for 20 May, with the 58th/59th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the Buin Road and the Aitara Track to the east of the river, while on the left the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion would divert the attention of the Japanese off the 24th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line, crossing at the Pororei ford, advancing straight up the Buin Road. Preliminary moves began before this, and on 15 May a platoon from the 24th Infantry Battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on Egan's Ridge. After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a Japanese field gun, they were forced to withdraw. Meanwhile, the RNZAF Corsair squadrons\u2014now reinforced by No. 16 Squadron\u2014began an eight-day aerial campaign, attacking along the length of the Buin and Commando Roads.

With artillery and air support, they were able to make steady gains, pushing the Japanese back and slowly encircling the remaining strongpoints.\n\nBy the end of the day, the Australians had secured a foothold on the northern edge of Hongorai, and the Japanese were forced to withdraw to the southeastern sector of the village. Though they still held out, their resistance was now fragmented and disorganized, and it was clear that their grip on the town was beginning to slip.\n\nAs night fell, the Australians consolidated their gains and prepared to launch a final push to clear the remaining Japanese from Hongorai.

{"prefix": "At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes.", "gold": "Fighting between Aborigines and Europeans was localised as the Aborigines did not form confederations capable of sustained resistance. As a result, there was not a single war, but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent. Organised or disorganised however, a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century. This warfare contradicts the popular and at times academic \"myth\" of peaceful settlement in Australia. Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence, resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres. Among the most famous is the Battle of Pinjarra in Western Australia in 1834. Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however, and after the Myall Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings. However, in Tasmania the so-called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832, and aimed at driving most of the island's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas. Although it began in failure for the British, it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population. It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Aborigines. Although many more Aborigines died than British, this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans. Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre-existing hunting and fighting practices\u2014using spears, clubs and other primitive weapons. Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main Aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans. Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them. On occasions large groups of Aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the Aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aborigines than the Europeans. Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms.", "text1": "Despite the involvement of some Aboriginal groups in the colonial forces, many others continued to resist the encroachment of European settlement. In the 1880s, a series of conflicts broke out in Western Australia, known as the Kimberley Wars, as Aboriginal groups, including the Bunuba and Waljeri people, fought against the arrival of white settlers and the construction of a telegraph line. The conflicts were marked by violence and atrocities on both sides, with many Aboriginal people being killed or displaced.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Australian government implemented a range of policies aimed at assimilating Aboriginal people into European culture, including forced removal of children from their families and relocation to missions and reserves. This period, known as the Stolen Generations, saw the forced assimilation of thousands of Aboriginal children, leading to widespread trauma and cultural disruption.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was a growing movement among Aboriginal people and their supporters for recognition of their rights and cultural heritage. In 1967, a referendum was held in which Australian voters were asked to approve changes to the Australian constitution to allow the federal government to make laws for Aboriginal people. The referendum was overwhelmingly supported, and it marked a significant turning point in the struggle for Aboriginal rights.", "text2": "As the frontier wars raged on, a small but notable number of Aboriginal people began to adapt to the changes brought about by white settlement, often through forced assimilation and conversion to Christianity.

Sonic the Hedgehog was praised by critics, with an 86% rating at the review aggregator GameRankings. It was considered Sega's answer to Nintendo's widely popular Mario series, as it was a platformer featuring the company's mascot. Paul Rand of Computer and Video Games compared the two in depth and characterized Sonic the Hedgehog as being faster, with brighter colors, and Super Mario World as having more \"depth of play\". Frank Ladoire of believed Sonic the Hedgehog was part of a new generation of games that demonstrate that the Genesis is capable of \"beautiful things\" in the technical department. Reviewers praised the colorful, detailed graphics. Rand called its color scheme \"lively, but never garish\", praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites, backgrounds, and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis. Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds \"eye-popping\" and \"gorgeous\", which was echoed by Mean Machines. The Lessers (Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk) of Dragon claimed the graphics made Sonic a possible contender for the best game of 1991 and GameZone called the animation \"some of the smoothest and fastest ... ever seen\".

The music and sound effects were also well received; Dragon called them \"great\", and GameZone \"amazing\". Rand praised the \"catchy\" soundtrack, calling some of the sound effects \"absolutely brilliant\". Although Mean Machines called the songs \"vaguely appealing\", the sound effects were better appreciated. However, Boardman of Raze considered the music \"a little boring\".

Within days of the battle, Charlestonians learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. The British troops were reembarked on their transports, and on July 21 the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in its campaign against New York City. To add insult to injury, one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by Patriot forces. The British did not return to Charleston until 1780, when General Clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army. Until the South again became a focus of the war in late 1778, its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort. Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle, each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition's failures. Although Clinton was not blamed by the government, popular opinion held him responsible, and Parker was lauded for his personal bravery. Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort Moultrie shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William Moultrie for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston. Extensively modified in the years after the battle, it was supplanted by Fort Sumter as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War. In 1876, to celebrate the centennial, companies from Savannah, Augusta, Macon, Columbia, New York and Boston were invited to Charleston. The site was turned over to the National Park Service in 1960, and is now part of Fort Sumter National Monument. A small monument to the Battle of Sullivan's Island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island, overlooking the inlet where General Clinton's soldiers had hoped to cross. The monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement. One iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by Colonel Moultrie. Commissioned by the colonial government, he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner, which was flown at the fort during the battle.

The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the UPDB. A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle Tours by seventy years, the route followed \"a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ...\" This route followed the modern US 2 from Ironwood to the M\u201194 junction in Manistique, using the modern M\u201169 and M\u201195 to stay in Michigan. Branches of the route followed US 41 and M\u201135 between Powers and Escanaba. The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan. The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well. In 1920, the King's International Highway linked Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the Trans-Canada Highway name. The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was M\u201112, a designation that was in use by July 1, 1919, between Ironwood and Sault Ste. Marie.

Parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions up and down the coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there. John Rutledge, recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina's revolutionary government, organized a defense force under the command of 46-year-old Colonel William Moultrie, a former militiaman and Indian fighter. These forces comprised three infantry regiments, two rifle regiments, and a small artillery regiment; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies, and the total force numbered about 2,000. These forces were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and Virginia (1,900 troops), as well as militia numbering 2,700 from Charleston and the surrounding backcountry. Moultrie saw Sullivan's Island, a sandy spit of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about long and a few hundred yards wide, as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from intruding enemy warships. A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar, a series of submerged shoals lying about southeast of the city, and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan's Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor. Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island, where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city. Moultrie and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan's Island in March 1776, and began construction of a fortress built out of palmetto logs to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor. The construction moved slowly; Captain Peter Horry of the Patriot naval detachment described the site as \"an immense pen 500 feet long, and 16 feet wide, filled with sand to stop the shot\". The gun platforms were made of planks two inches thick and fastened with wooden spikes. Congress had appointed General Lee to command the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies, and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton's fleet as it sailed south. Lee wrote from Wilmington on June 1 that the fleet had sailed, but that he did not know whether it was sailing for Virginia or South Carolina.

Cornwallis knew he had to act quickly to secure his position and prevent a potential disaster.\n\nHe dispatched a portion of his troops to fortify the port city of Wilmington, while also sending out reconnaissance parties to gather intelligence on the French fleet's movements. Meanwhile, his naval commander, Admiral Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Suffren, set sail to engage the French and disrupt their supply lines.

The stormy seas had claimed several vessels, and many more were badly damaged, with leaks and broken masts threatening to send the remaining ships to the bottom. As the sailors set about repairing their battered craft, Cornwallis, who had arrived earlier that month, looked on with a mixture of concern and disdain.\n\n\"Why did it take you so long, General Parker?\" he asked, his tone icy as the spring air. \"We were supposed to be here weeks ago, and now we are already falling behind schedule.\"\n\nParker, tired and frustrated, shot back, \"You know as well as I, General, that the sea has its own whims, and we are at its mercy. We did our best, and we arrived as quickly as was possible given the circumstances.\"\n\nCornwallis snorted, dismissing the excuse with a wave of his hand. \"Enough, General Parker. We have no time for excuses. We must press on with the campaign, and that requires getting our troops and supplies moved to the interior of the colony as quickly as possible.\"\n\nParker nodded stiffly, knowing that Cornwallis was right.

Parker wasted no time in checking the ships for damage and caring for the injured. Numerous ships were lost at sea during the storm, while others suffered significant damage that put them at risk of sinking. Cornwallis observed with a mix of worry and contempt as the sailors worked on fixing their damaged ships. General Parker, why did you delay your arrival? He inquired with a cold demeanor matching the chilly spring weather. \"We were meant to arrive weeks earlier, and now we're already lagging behind.\" Parker responded, attributing the delay to the unpredictable nature of the sea. We made every effort to arrive promptly considering the situation. Cornwallis scoffed and disregarded the excuse with a gesture. \"General Parker, that's sufficient.\" There is no room for justifications. It is imperative that we continue the campaign by swiftly relocating our troops and supplies to the colony's interior. Parker acknowledged Cornwallis' correctness with a stiff nod.

While home in Ohio over a summer break, he met local drag racer Raymond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller. When Richmond reached age 16, his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am, a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said, \"Tim was lazy...\", and \"... I did everything for him. I ruined him, I admit it. He was my whole life.\" Richmond excelled in sports; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his gridiron days were over. Miami Military Academy named him Athlete of the Year in 1970. Richmond's other interests included flying, and he earned his private pilot license at age 16. Following high school graduation, Richmond attended Ashland University for about one year before dropping out. A friend of Richmond's father co-owned a sprint car and Richmond joined the team as a crew member for Dave Shoemaker. In 1976, 21-year-old Richmond took the car onto Lakeville Speedway at Lakeville, Ohio for some practice laps. \"Somebody put a stopwatch on me,\" Richmond said. \"I was running laps faster than Dave had been. It was the first time I had ever driven a race car.\" Richmond and his father found a red, white and blue-colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania, which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child. In his first competition at the track, officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat. He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle.", "text1": "As a child, Richmond was fascinated by his parents' stories about their jobs, which sparked his curiosity about the world beyond Ashland. His mother, Evelyn, was a librarian, and Richmond would often accompany her on visits to the local elementary schools, where she would read to the students. His father, Al, worked as a landscape designer, and Richmond would join him on weekends to help with gardening and yard work. These experiences instilled in Richmond a love for literature and the natural world, which would shape his creative pursuits as he grew older.", "text2": "As a result, Al, a machinist, and Evelyn, a high school English teacher, instilled in their son an appreciation for the arts and a strong work ethic. Richmond's early life was spent exploring the scenic Hocking River and surrounding countryside, where he developed a passion for storytelling and a keen sense of observation. His parents encouraged his creativity, supporting his early attempts at writing and music-making, even recording his first compositions on a homemade tape deck in the family's attic.", "text3": "Al, a machinist, and Evelyn, a high school English teacher, taught their son to value the arts and hard work.

However, the Marines, who had been alerted to the impending attack, were well-prepared and entrenched on the ridge, with a strong defensive perimeter.\n\nAs the Japanese troops emerged from the darkness, they were met with a hail of machine gun fire and artillery shells, which severely disrupted their advance. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the Marines fought bravely, pinning down the Japanese troops with accurate fire and preventing them from gaining a foothold on the ridge.\n\nOver the next two days, the battle raged on, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.

{"prefix": "The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied, but were inevitably hostile when the settlers' presence led to competition over resources, and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants' lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation.", "gold": "By and large neither the British nor the Aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare. At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes. Fighting between Aborigines and Europeans was localised as the Aborigines did not form confederations capable of sustained resistance. As a result, there was not a single war, but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent. Organised or disorganised however, a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century. This warfare contradicts the popular and at times academic \"myth\" of peaceful settlement in Australia. Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence, resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres. Among the most famous is the Battle of Pinjarra in Western Australia in 1834. Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however, and after the Myall Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings. However, in Tasmania the so-called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832, and aimed at driving most of the island's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas. Although it began in failure for the British, it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population. It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Aborigines. Although many more Aborigines died than British, this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans. Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre-existing hunting and fighting practices\u2014using spears, clubs and other primitive weapons. Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main Aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans. Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread.", "text1": "As the British settlers continued to arrive in large numbers, the Aboriginal people were faced with the devastating consequences of cultural erosion. Their traditional ways of life were being disrupted, and their sense of identity and belonging was being threatened. Many Aboriginal people were forced to adapt to the new colonizers' way of life, learning their language and adopting their customs. However, this process of assimilation was often violent and coercive, with Aboriginal children being taken from their families and forced to attend boarding schools where they were subjected to physical and emotional abuse.\n\nThe British also brought with them their own system of law, which was often in conflict with the traditional laws and customs of the Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people who resisted the colonizers' presence or fought back against their encroachment on their lands were punished severely, with many being executed or imprisoned. The once-thriving Aboriginal populations began to dwindle, and their traditional way of life was on the brink of extinction.\n\nDespite the dire circumstances, some Aboriginal people continued to resist the colonizers' presence, using guerrilla warfare and other forms of resistance to fight back against their oppressors. The most famous of these resistance fighters was Pemulwuy, a Wiradjuri warrior who led a series of attacks against British settlers in New South Wales. His bravery and leadership inspired other Aboriginal people to take up arms against the colonizers, but ultimately, his efforts were unsuccessful, and he was killed in a skirmish with British soldiers in 1802.\n\nAs the years passed, the British continued to expand their settlements and establish new colonies, gradually pushing the Aboriginal people to the fringes of their own land. The native inhabitants were forced to adapt to a new reality, one in which their way of life was slowly being erased. Despite this, many Aboriginal people continued to hold on to their culture, passing it down to their children and grandchildren, and keeping the memories of their ancestors alive.", "text2": "As the British settlers continued to expand their colonies, the conflicts escalated, and many Aboriginal groups were forcibly removed from their ancestral lands. The British implemented policies aimed at assimilating the indigenous population into European culture, including forced reeducation, conversion to Christianity, and prohibition of traditional practices. These measures were often violent and coerced, resulting in the deaths of countless Aboriginal people and the destruction of their cultural heritage.\n\nResistance to British occupation came in the form of guerrilla warfare, spearheading conflicts such as the Black War in Tasmania and the Pinjarra Massacre in Western Australia. Despite these armed uprisings, the British response was often ruthless and disproportionate, leading to the deaths of thousands of Aboriginal people and the devastation of their communities.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the British colonization of Australia had effectively erased many of the indigenous population's ways of life, leading to widespread poverty, malnutrition, and diseases that had been previously unknown. The Aboriginal people's connection to their land, culture, and identity was repeatedly disrupted, and many were reduced to marginalized and disadvantaged groups in Australian society.\n\nToday, the descendants of the indigenous Aboriginal people in Australia continue to struggle for recognition, justice, and reconciliation for past wrongs, and to assert their rights and identity as the traditional custodians of the Australian continent.", "text3": "The conflicts between British settlers and Aboriginal groups intensified as the colonies expanded, leading to the forced removal of many Aboriginal people from their traditional lands.

Everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie, including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September 27, 1910, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one pie split eight ways would be able to impact everyone. The film is presumed lost. Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24, 1910. It states: \"Life in a country town is often tedious and tiresome, and were it not for the little dinners and teas the townsfolk are constantly given, existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed. So the time honored get-togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay. The Gales thought well of this established feature. They made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests. They were hardly an overly wealthy family, and their table was never notable for an oversupply of the good things of life, but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time.\" \"On the night before such an event neither Mamma, Pappa, or Daughter Gale could get those minutes' solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests' comfort. At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape. So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors.", "text1": "...but things quickly go awry when the family's well-meaning but hapless patriarch, Mr. Gale, attempts to make the traditional English dessert, mince pie, from scratch.

Some fellow pupils became hostile, though he says they were just trying to \"have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter\" rather than acting out of jealousy.", "gold": "As his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors. He admitted he was not a very good student, considering school useless and finding the work \"really difficult\". He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. \"The paparazzi, they'd love it\", he told Details magazine in 2007. \"If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were.\" Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at age five, and, aged ten, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield (1999), portraying the title character as a young boy. Radcliffe made his film debut in The Tailor of Panama (2001), an American film based on John le Carr\u00e9's 1996 spy novel, and a moderate commercial success. In 2000, producer David Heyman asked Radcliffe to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling book by British author J. K. Rowling. Rowling had been searching for an unknown British actor to personify the character, and the film's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, \"This is what I want. This is Harry Potter\" after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield. Eight months later, following several auditions, Radcliffe was selected to play the part. Rowling endorsed the selection, saying: \"I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\" Radcliffe's parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two-film contract with shooting in the UK; Radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would act in more than two Harry Potter films. The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone took place in 2001.", "text1": "Despite the initial bullying, Radcliffe tried to adapt to the changed dynamics at school. He recalls that some of his classmates even started to treat him with a newfound respect, having seen him on screen and admiring his performance as the Boy Who Lived. However, the increased attention also made it challenging for him to maintain a sense of normalcy in his daily life.\n\nAs the fame surrounding the Harry Potter franchise grew, Radcliffe found himself struggling to balance his love for acting with the demands of his celebrity status. He began to feel like he was living in a fishbowl, with every move he made scrutinized by the media and his fans. He started to wonder if he would ever be able to step back from the spotlight and simply be himself, without the pressure of being a global superstar.\n\nOne day, Radcliffe decided to take a break from the madness and enrolled in a play at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. The experience proved to be a welcome respite from the constant attention, allowing him to focus on his craft and explore different characters beyond the iconic role of Harry Potter. It was during this time that Radcliffe discovered a newfound appreciation for the art of acting and began to see himself as more than just a child star.\n\nLittle did he know, this newfound passion would set him on a path that would lead him to explore a wide range of roles and projects, ultimately cementing his status as a talented and versatile actor in his own right, beyond the wizarding world.", "text2": "As the filming of the subsequent Potter movies took over more and more of his time, Radcliffe began to feel increasingly like an outsider at school.

They mocked his \"wimpy\" haircut, teased him about his \"Harry\" costume, and whispered to each other whenever he walked by.\n\nDespite his efforts to fit in, Radcliffe felt like an imposter among his peers. His schedule was dictated by filming commitments, and his time at school became fragmented and stressful. His grades began to suffer as he struggled to keep up with his coursework, and his once-fun classmates now regarded him with suspicion and disdain.\n\nBut Radcliffe didn't let the negativity bring him down. Instead, he threw himself into his passion for acting, using his frustrations at school as fuel for his creative endeavors. He honed his craft, studying Shakespeare and technique, and landed small roles on stage and screen to supplement his work on the Potter franchise.\n\nBy the time Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was released, Radcliffe felt ready to leave school behind, even if only for a brief respite. With his parents' approval, he opted out of finishing high school and devoted himself to the next chapter of the Potter saga.", "text3": "Radcliffe started to feel more and more like an outsider at school as he became busier with filming the later Potter movies.

Filming obligations controlled his schedule, causing his time at school to be chaotic and overwhelming. His academic performance declined as he found it challenging to stay on top of his schoolwork, and his previously friendly classmates now viewed him with skepticism and contempt. However, Radcliffe remained resilient in the face of the negativity. He channeled his frustrations at school into his love for acting, dedicating himself fully to his creative pursuits.

It was a year in which other FBI informants had been discovered in AIM.", "gold": "On November 3, 1999, Means held a press conference in Denver, Colorado in which he accused the Bellecourt brothers of complicity in Aquash's death, and named three lower-level AIM members involved in her death: Arlo Looking Cloud, John Graham, and Theda Nelson Clarke. This was the first time that an AIM leader active at the time of the Aquash murder had publicly accused AIM of having been involved. Looking Cloud and Graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010, by federal and South Dakota state juries, respectively. By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted. Means attributed the split in AIM to divisions in the aftermath of Aquash's murder. The journalist Harlan McKosato said in 1999, \"...her [Aquash's] death has divided the American Indian Movement...\" The schism continued, with the national AIM leadership claiming that the local AIM leaders, such as Churchill, are tools of the U.S. government used against other American Indians. The leaders of the national AIM organization, now called AIM Grand Governing Council, claim that Churchill has worked in the past as an underground counter-intelligence source for the U.S. government, for example the FBI, and local, non-Indian, police forces, to subvert the national AIM organization. Specifically, they refer to a 1993 Boulder, Colorado interview with Jodi Rave, a former columnist for the Denver Post, in which Churchill stated that he \"was teaching the Rapid City Police Department about the American Indian Movement.\" In addition, Vernon Bellecourt accused Churchill of having 'fraudulently represented himself as an Indian' to bolster his credentials. Bellecourt said he complained to the University of Colorado about this as early as 1986.

The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the Hongorai River. Following the end of the early fighting, the Australian advance towards the main Japanese concentration at Buin continued as they struck out towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. This continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective, washing away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians relied for supplies. As the Australian advance stalled, the Japanese began harassing the Australian line of communications, and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late-July and into August, the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards Buin again. Ultimately, though, the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began, bringing the campaign to an end. Japanese forces had landed on Bougainville in early 1942, capturing it from the small force of Australians garrisoning the island. They had subsequently developed several airbases on the island, using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the United States, Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area. These bases also helped protect Rabaul, the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea, and throughout 1943, Allied planners determined that Bougainville was vital for neutralising the Japanese base around Rabaul. US Marines conducted an amphibious landing at Cape Torokina, on the western coast of the island, north of Empress Augusta Bay, in November 1943. After an initial counter-attack, the US Marines had been replaced by a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around Torokina, establishing a strong perimeter. In March 1944, the Japanese launched a heavy counter-attack, which was turned back with heavy casualties.

However, many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade, while many others had returned to Australia. From 1870 until 1901, each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the 1870s\u2014including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units\u2014they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense. By 1885, the forces numbered 21,000 men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century, with the colonies raising contingents to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China. Despite a reputation of colonial inferiority, many of the locally raised units were highly organised, disciplined, professional, and well trained. During this period, defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery, based on garrisoned coastal forts. However, by the 1890s, improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards\u2014who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces\u2014to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry. As a consequence he called for a restructure of defences, and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies.

{"prefix": "In November 2008, the government abandoned its attempts to ban Scientology, after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity. The report by the BfV cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful.", "gold": "First, the BfV report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization; there were German churches and missions, a German board, German bylaws, and no evidence that the organization was \"totally remote-controlled\" from the United States. A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one. The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology's aggressive opposition to the constitution. Here, the report found that Scientology's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow Germany's free and democratic basic order. \"Neither its bylaws nor any other utterances\" supported the \"conclusion that the organization had criminal aims\". The BfV also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence, but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning. Commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt, Ehrhart K\u00f6rting, Berlin's interior minister, said, \"This organization pursues goals \u2013 through its writings, its concept and its disrespect for minorities \u2013 that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution. But they put very little of this into practice. The appraisal of the Government at the moment is that [Scientology] is a lousy organization, but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to.\" The Church of Scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision, describing it as the \"only one possible\". Monitoring of Scientology's activities by the German intelligence services continues. In February 2009, the Berlin Administrative Court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the Berlin Scientology headquarters, warning passers-by of the potential dangers Scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom, should be removed. The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg, which ruled that the poster violated Scientologists' basic religious rights. The United States media, while generally reporting negatively on Scientology in domestic news, has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards Scientology in relation to Germany. Richard Cohen for example, writing in The Washington Post, said in 1996: \"Scientology might be one weird religion, but the German reaction to it is weirder still \u2013 not to mention disturbing.\"", "text1": "The German authorities' decision to drop the ban was met with a mix of relief and disappointment from both sides of the religious spectrum. While some in the Scientology community celebrated the outcome as a victory for religious freedom, others within the Church of Scientology accused the government of caving in to pressure from organized crime groups that had infiltrated the organization.\n\nIn the years that followed, the BfV continued to monitor Scientology's activities in Germany, with a particular focus on its fundraising and recruitment methods. The agency's concerns were fueled by allegations of aggressive tactics and financial improprieties within the church, as well as reports of some members being coerced into committing financial crimes to benefit the organization.\n\nDespite these concerns, the German government maintained that it had no plans to revive the ban, citing the importance of upholding religious freedom and the principle of separation between church and state. However, the debate over Scientology's legitimacy and potential threats to German society continued to simmer, with many citizens expressing skepticism and even hostility towards the organization.\n\nIn 2011, a high-profile trial in Hamburg sent shockwaves through the Scientology community, as a former member accused the church of emotional and psychological manipulation, as well as financial exploitation. The trial shed light on the church's internal dynamics and its treatment of dissenting members, and led to widespread media coverage and public outcry.\n\nIn the wake of the trial, the German government launched a fresh review of Scientology's activities, with a focus on its corporate structure and financial dealings. While the church denied any wrongdoing, the government's investigation uncovered evidence of irregularities and potential fraud, leading to calls for greater transparency and accountability within the organization.\n\nAs the controversy surrounding Scientology continued to unfold, the debate over its status in German society showed no signs of abating. Many Germans remained wary of the church's influence and motives, while others saw it as a legitimate religious organization that deserved respect and protection. The battle for public perception and acceptance would continue to rage on, with no clear resolution in sight.", "text2": "The government's decision to shelve the potential ban led to widespread criticism from anti-Scientology groups and lawmakers, who argued that the organization's practices and beliefs continued to be a threat to public health and well-being. Despite the lack of concrete evidence of illegal activity, many claimed that the Church of Scientology was engaging in harmful practices, such as its controversial auditing techniques and its handling of sensitive information about its members.\n\nIn the years that followed, the Church of Scientology continued to grow and expand, with reports of rapid increases in its membership and financial resources. While some saw this as evidence of the organization's growing influence and acceptance, others remained concerned by its methods and beliefs.\n\nMeanwhile, the controversy surrounding Scientology continued to spark heated debates and protests. The organization's outspoken critics, including former members and anti-Scientology advocates, continued to urge the government to take action, while the Church of Scientology continued to push back against what it described as unfair allegations.\n\nToday, the Church of Scientology remains a contentious and polarizing force, with many people continuing to question its practices and beliefs. Despite the government's decision to abandon its efforts to ban the organization, the debate over its legitimacy and impact is unlikely to be settled anytime soon.", "text3": "The government faced backlash from anti-Scientology groups and lawmakers for not implementing a potential ban, as they believed the organization's practices posed a threat to public health and well-being. Many argued that the Church of Scientology was engaging in harmful practices, including controversial auditing techniques and mishandling sensitive member information, despite the absence of clear proof of illegal activity. Over time, the Church of Scientology saw significant growth in both its membership and financial resources. Some viewed the organization's expansion positively, while others continued to express reservations about its practices and beliefs. At the same time, debates and protests over Scientology remained intense. Critics of the Church of Scientology persisted in calling for government intervention, while the organization defended itself against what it viewed as unjust accusations. The Church of Scientology is still a divisive presence, with ongoing scrutiny of its practices and beliefs. The ongoing debate surrounding the legitimacy and impact of the organization is expected to continue despite the government's decision to halt its ban efforts.", "detect1": {"z_score": 2.24719276247515, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.5561097256857855, "p_value": 0.012313855265322889}, "detect2": {"z_score": 9.346692235101406, "prediction": true, "green_fraction": 0.7991803278688525, "p_value": 4.521580897323652e-21}, "detect3": {"z_score": 4.041451884327381, "prediction": true, "green_fraction": 0.6458333333333334, "p_value": 2.656064079705857e-05}, "curr_idx": 262}
{"prefix": "A mass of and an inclination of 24\u00b0 were later found using high-resolution spectroscopy. Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface.", "gold": "The Spitzer Space Telescope measured the planet temperature, and found that the difference between the two sides of Upsilon Andromedae b of about 1,400 degrees Celsius, ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1,400 to 1,650 degrees Celsius. The temperature difference has led to speculation that Upsilon Andromedae b is tidal locked with the same side always facing Upsilon Andromedae A. Sudarsky had, on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium, predicted Upsilon Andromedae b to have reflective clouds of silicates and iron in its upper atmosphere. The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun's radiation; between that and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. The outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides, but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The chemical elements in the atmosphere can be studied by finding their absorption lines in the thermal spectrum of the planet; given typical planet temperatures, the spectrum has its peak at infrared wavelengths. So far, only water vapor has been detected in this planet, while carbon monoxide and methane are still under the detection limit. The planet is unlikely to have large moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system. The planet (with 51 Pegasi b) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by Planetpol. Preliminary results from polarimetric studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color, is 1.36 times as large and 0.74 times as massive as Jupiter, meaning that the mean density is 0.36g/cm3. It has a geometric albedo of 0.35 in visible light. Tidal heating models predict a similar mass for the planet. Upsilon Andromedae b appears to be responsible for increased chromospheric activity on its parent star. Observations suggest that there is a \"hot spot\" on the star around 169\u00b0 away from the sub-planetary point. This may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star. The mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of RS Canum Venaticorum variable stars, or the interaction between Jupiter and its moon Io.", "text1": "As a gas giant, Upsilon Andromedae b is likely to have a thick atmosphere, possibly composed of hydrogen and helium, which would be invisible from Earth. The discovery of a strong infrared signal from the planet suggests that it may have a system of rings or a massive moon, potentially indicative of a complex orbital dynamics. Further studies using space-based telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope will be needed to confirm these hypotheses and uncover more secrets about this distant world. Meanwhile, the unique properties of Upsilon Andromedae b have sparked renewed interest in the search for other similar gas giants orbiting nearby stars, offering a promising avenue for future exoplanetary research.", "text2": "Further studies using advanced computer simulations and hydrodynamic models revealed that the thick atmosphere of Upsilon Andromedae b is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium gases, with traces of methane, ammonia, and water vapor. The planet's gravity is so strong that it keeps these gases compressed at high pressures, creating a heated and corrosive environment that makes any solid surface unlikely to exist.\n\nAs the team of scientists continued to analyze the data, they discovered that the planet's magnetic field is also unusually strong, suggesting that it may be powered by a liquid iron-nickel core. This, combined with the presence of atmospheric particles and potential volcanic activity, raises the intriguing possibility that Upsilon Andromedae b may be hosting its own analog of Earth's geologic activity, but with a vastly different composition and scale.\n\nThe discovery of Upsilon Andromedae b has significant implications for our understanding of planetary formation and evolution. As one of the first known exoplanets to be studied in detail, it provides a unique window into the formation processes of gas giant planets, and challenges our current models of how massive worlds are shaped by planetary migration and interactions with their parent star.", "text3": "Advanced computer simulations and hydrodynamic models showed that Upsilon Andromedae b's thick atmosphere is primarily made up of hydrogen and helium, along with small amounts of methane, ammonia, and water vapor. The intense gravitational pull of the planet maintains a pressurized atmosphere of gases, resulting in a harsh and hot environment where solid surfaces are improbable. Further analysis by the scientists revealed that the planet's magnetic field is exceptionally robust, indicating a potential source of power from a liquid iron-nickel core. The possibility of Upsilon Andromedae b having its own version of Earth's geologic activity, albeit with different materials and on a larger scale, is intriguing due to atmospheric particles and potential volcanic activity. The findings about Upsilon Andromedae b have important implications for our knowledge of how planets are formed and change over time.

{"prefix": "Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service, known as the New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804.", "gold": "Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion, a coup mounted by its officers in 1808. As a result, in January 1810 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By 1870, 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units. Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack, no actual threat ever materialised. The British Army was instead used in policing, guarding convicts at penal institutions, combating bushranging, putting down convict rebellions\u2014as occurred at Bathurst in 1830\u2014and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement. Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 on the Victorian goldfields. Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan. During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by units detached by the Royal Navy's Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, based in Sydney. However, in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a commodore, marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia. The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913, when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy; the Royal Navy's depots, dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people. The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied, but were inevitably hostile when the settlers' presence led to competition over resources, and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants' lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation. By and large neither the British nor the Aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare. At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes.", "text1": "The New South Wales Corps continued to play a significant role in the early history of Australian settlement, with some of its members engaging in corrupt practices and exacerbating tensions between the British and Indigenous Australians. In 1810, Governor William Bligh was overthrown in the Rum Rebellion, a mutiny led by the Corps' commander, John Macarthur, who was dissatisfied with Bligh's efforts to reduce the Corps' powers and curb corruption.\n\nThe Rum Rebellion marked the beginning of a period of instability and conflict in the colony, which was further complicated by the arrival of new British immigrants and the expansion of the penal colony. In 1815, the British government dispatched a new governor, Lachlan Macquarie, to restore order and stability to the colony. Macquarie implemented a series of reforms, including the establishment of new infrastructure and the development of the colony's economy.\n\nDespite these efforts, tensions between the British and Indigenous Australians continued to escalate, culminating in the Bathurst War of 1824-1825. The war was sparked by a series of violent incidents between British settlers and Indigenous Australians, including the massacre of several Indigenous Australians at Myall Creek. The war ultimately ended with the defeat of the Indigenous Australians and the imposition of British rule over the entire continent.\n\nThe legacy of the New South Wales Corps continued to shape the early history of Australian settlement, with many of its members leaving a lasting impact on the country's politics, economy, and culture. The Corps' involvement in the Rum Rebellion and its role in the conflict with Indigenous Australians served as a reminder of the complex and often tumultuous history of the early Australian colonies.", "text2": "As the years passed, the New South Wales Corps became notorious for its involvement in the colony's affairs, often more concerned with personal gain and indulgence than with upholding its responsibilities. Corruption and brutality were rampant within its ranks, and its officers often treated the native population with disdain and cruelty. The corps was disbanded in 1810, and its remaining members were incorporated into the British Army.\n\nIn the meantime, a group of influential settlers had begun calling for greater control over the colony, and in 1821, the British government responded by establishing a council system, with a five-man Legislative Council tasked with governing the colony. However, the council was heavily weighted towards government-appointed officials, and many of the colony's early settlers felt that their interests were still being ignored.\n\nTensions continued to simmer, and it wasn't until the appointment of Governor Richard Bourke in 1831 that significant changes began to take place. Bourke was a strong advocate for greater representative democracy in the colony, and he worked tirelessly to promote the idea of electing a more representative legislative body. His efforts eventually bore fruit, and in 1835, the British government passed the Australian Constitutions Act, paving the way for a more representative form of government in the colony.\n\nOver time, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly grew into a more representative institution, and its role became central to the governance of the colony. The assembly was eventually replaced in 1856 by a more modern system of parliament, with a Legislative Assembly and a Legislative Council, and the colony of New South Wales took its first tentative steps towards self-government.", "text3": "Over time, the New South Wales Corps gained a reputation for prioritizing personal gain and indulgence over fulfilling its duties in the colony.

The song was written in B.", "gold": "It uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating, followed by the final two verses and a coda. Lead Belly first recorded \"The Bourgeois Blues\" in December 1938 in New York City, for donation to the Library of Congress. He re-recorded the song in April 1939 for Musicraft Records, for release the same year as a 78 rpm record. The version that was commercially released features Lead Belly singing and playing the twelve-string guitar without any other accompaniment. The song has been covered and reinterpreted by a variety of artists including Pete Seeger and Hans Theessink. Seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums. In Australia, the song was reworked as \"Canberra Blues\" by The Bitter Lemons, an R&B band. The lyrics speak of the problems faced by young Australians in the Australian Capital Territory in the 1960s. Theessink adapted the song to his style of European blues for the album Journey On in 1997. In 2006, Billy Bragg reworked the song as \"Bush War Blues\". Bragg's cover is a topical protest song about the Iraq War. In one verse, Bragg claims that the Iraq War was not for democracy but instead was to \"make the world safe for Halliburton\". In another, he takes on the Christian right, asking where the moderates are. Finally, Bragg chides the United States government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war. \"The Bourgeois Blues\" is one of Lead Belly's most famous songs and is remembered as his most \"heartfelt protest song\". There is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance. Robert Springer claims that the song is \"peripheral\" to the wider study of the blues, while Lawson points to it as a watershed in the way African Americans see themselves in the fabric of the United States. There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics. After its release, it became popular with left-wing political groups. Lead Belly was invited to perform at Camp Unity, the Communist Party USA's summer retreat, and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s. This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform. The party claims, to the contrary, that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform. Jeff Todd Titon and several other writers have suggested that Lead Belly had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song.", "text1": "The chord progression is a ii-V-I in the key of B minor, with a slight modification to create a sense of tension and release.

{"prefix": "Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product. As noted above, variants that deviate from this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation.", "gold": "In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule must be in the s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with \u03b1-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating \u03b1-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation. Similarly, \u03b2-substitution directed inward restricts the s-trans conformation so severely that E-Z isomerization has been shown to occur in advance of cyclization on a wide range of substrates, yielding the trans cyclopentenone regardless of initial configuration. In this way, the Nazarov cyclization is a rare example of a stereoselective pericyclic reaction, whereas most electrocyclizations are stereospecific. The example below uses triethylsilyl hydride to trap the oxyallyl cation so that no elimination occurs. (See Interrupted cyclizations below) Along this same vein, allenyl vinyl ketones of the type studied extensively by Marcus Tius of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of \u03b2-hydrogens, obviating a large amount of steric strain in the s-cis conformer. Though cyclizations following the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov's involvement, it was his study of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process. Nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product. The reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone. Research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years, until in the mid-1980s when several syntheses employing the Nazarov cyclization were published. Shown below are key steps in the syntheses of Trichodiene and Nor-Sterepolide, the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual alkyne-allene isomerization that generates the divinyl ketone.", "text1": "The resulting oxyallyl cation is then susceptible to rearrangement to form the cyclopentenone ring, a process facilitated by the high energy state of the system. In some cases, the Nazarov cyclization can be influenced by the presence of additional functional groups, such as alkyl or aryl substituents, which can impact the stereoselectivity of the reaction or alter the regiochemistry of the product. Despite these variations, the Nazarov cyclization remains a powerful tool for the construction of complex organic molecules, and its versatility has made it a staple of synthetic organic chemistry.", "text2": "The resulting oxyallyl cation then readily undergoes electrocyclic fragmentation to produce the cyclopentenone ring system, often in good to excellent yields. The high degree of stereoselectivity exhibited by the Nazarov cyclization can be attributed to the concerted, pericyclic nature of the process, where the formation of the oxyallyl cation is kinetically controlled and proceeds through a transition state where the substituents at the reacting atoms are held in proximity, leading to the formation of the product ring with predictable stereochemical outcome.", "text3": "The oxyallyl cation formed easily breaks apart to form the cyclopentenone ring system, usually with high yields. The specific stereochemistry observed in the Nazarov cyclization is due to the synchronized, cyclic nature of the reaction, where the oxyallyl cation formation is controlled by kinetics and occurs through a transition state that positions the substituents close together, resulting in a predictable stereochemical result in the product ring.", "detect1": {"z_score": 1.0954451150103321, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.55, "p_value": 0.13666083914614907}, "detect2": {"z_score": 4.840705778337745, "prediction": true, "green_fraction": 0.7297297297297297, "p_value": 6.468940293941927e-07}, "detect3": {"z_score": 2.03701381619181, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.6091954022988506, "p_value": 0.020824328744523946}, "curr_idx": 267}

The Sault\u2013Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of US 2 between Escanaba and St. Ignace. The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste. Marie. In the age of the auto trail, the roads that later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names. When the original roadways between Ironwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau (UPDB) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. Through the UP, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US 2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin. The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the UPDB. A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle Tours by seventy years, the route followed \"a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ...\" This route followed the modern US 2 from Ironwood to the M\u201194 junction in Manistique, using the modern M\u201169 and M\u201195 to stay in Michigan.

The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF's ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF's ability to mount and sustain such operations. In response, the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Australian government committed to improve the ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF to 57,000 full-time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year. In May 2006, 2,000 ADF personnel were again deployed to East Timor as part of Operation Astute, following unrest between elements of the Timor Leste Defence Force. Australian forces were involved in a number skirmishes during this time, including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by Alfredo Reinado at Same on 4 March 2007.

I'll show you my true power!\"\n\nBut I'm Sonic, the fastest creature in the world! I dash towards Dr. Robotnik, ready to unleash my most devastating spin attack.

{"prefix": "From the mid-1990s onward, press articles, reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis, accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience. As noted by the religious scholar Hubert Seiwert, Scientology came to be seen as a \"serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will-less zombies, but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state\".", "gold": "This view of Scientology as a public enemy, Seiwert adds, \"became a matter of political correctness\": senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology, and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social ostracism. Stephen A. Kent, writing in 1998, noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed. Scientology was viewed as \"a totalitarian, business-driven organization [...] guilty of significant human rights abuses.\" Officials examining primary and secondary sources, legal documents, and the testimony of former members, concluded that the organization was \"antithetical to a democratic state\". Federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology. Government publications on the dangers of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, in large part because of public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services. An area of widespread concern in the German media has been the alleged \"infiltration\" of businesses by Scientologists, in line with Scientology's declared aim to penetrate society, politics and business in preparation for world domination. Attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium-size companies, such as estate agents, management consultants and management-training companies.", "text1": "This media frenzy culminated in 2005 with the release of the Emmy Award-winning documentary \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief\", which premiered on HBO and sparked widespread outrage and public scrutiny. The film's expos\u00e9 on the Church's alleged abuses, including allegations of physical and emotional manipulation, forced disconnection from loved ones, and financial exploitation, further solidified the perception of Scientology as a dangerous and predatory organization.\n\nAs a result, the Church of Scientology faced increased scrutiny and criticism from government agencies, human rights organizations, and the general public. In 2009, the French government officially recognized Scientology as a \"dangerous cult\" and banned it from operating in the country. Similar restrictions were imposed in Germany, Belgium, and other European nations.\n\nThe Church responded with lawsuits and public relations campaigns, but the negative publicity continued to mount. Celebrity members, once proud to be associated with the Church, began to distance themselves or abandon their affiliation altogether. Tom Cruise, once one of Scientology's most high-profile advocates, was conspicuously absent from the Church's promotional efforts.\n\nBy the mid-2010s, the Church's reputation had reached a new low. A 2015 expose by the St. Petersburg Times (now Tampa Bay Times) revealed a pattern of financial mismanagement, including millions of dollars spent on lavish construction projects and expensive lawsuits. The Church's leader, David Miscavige, was accused of authoritarianism, emotional abuse, and physical violence against followers.\n\nIn the face of mounting criticism, the Church launched a series of public relations campaigns aimed at rehabilitating its image. However, these efforts were met with skepticism by many who had been deeply affected by Scientology's alleged abuses. As the organization's popularity continued to wane, the once-mighty Church of Scientology was left to confront the consequences of its own controversial past.", "text2": "The fervent media scrutiny and public scrutiny of Scientology culminated in the formation of the French anti-Scientology group, the Union des Associations pour Securite Civile, in the late 1990s. The organization, comprised of journalists, psychologists, and ex Scientologists, worked tirelessly to expose what they saw as the Church's abusive practices, including forced labor, emotional manipulation, and psychological abuse. The French government responded by opening an investigation into the Church's activities, leading to the eventual conviction of Scientology officials on charges of organized fraud, pyramid schemes, and alienation of assets in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, in the United States, the Church of Scientology continued to face criticism and scrutiny from prominent voices in the media and academia. Authors such as Lawrence Wright, who wrote the bestselling book \"Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief\" in 2013, and journalists like Jane Lehman, who produced a four-part series on Scientology for ABC News, further amplified public awareness of the Church's controversial practices and beliefs.\n\nBy the mid-2010s, the Church of Scientology was facing increased legal and financial pressure, with several former high-ranking officials, including Marty Rathbun, a former second-in-command of the Church, speaking out publicly against the Church's practices and leadership. As the Church's influence and membership continued to dwindle, it became clear that the era of secrecy and suppression was coming to an end, and that the Church of Scientology would need to adapt to a more transparency-driven and accountability-conscious society.", "text3": "Intense media and public attention on Scientology led to the creation of the French anti-Scientology group, the Union des Associations pour Securite Civile, in the late 1990s.

In 2009, Scientology officials were convicted of organized fraud, pyramid schemes, and alienation of assets after a French government investigation. In the United States, the Church of Scientology faced ongoing criticism and scrutiny from influential figures in the media and academia. Lawrence Wright and Jane Lehman increased public knowledge of Scientology through their respective works. In the mid-2010s, the Church of Scientology encountered growing legal and financial challenges as former top officials, like Marty Rathbun, publicly criticized the Church's actions and leadership.

Bail was deposited in the court's bank account on mid-day of July 3, 2012. After this, the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint. Due to public holidays it was not until July 9, 2012, that the State Attorney filed his complaint, which was to be dealt with by appellate court, the Prague Municipal Court. On July 17, 2012, Prague Municipal Court's panel of three judges headed by judge Lubo\u0161 Vrba overturned the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to CZK 8 million (~ US$ 400,000). After this, the State Attorney challenged the conditions of release, trying to achieve that the bail is subject to Blythe staying in the country and/or Blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished. On August 2, 2012, the appellate court rejected the State Attorney's second complaint and ordered Blythe's immediate release. Blythe left the Czech Republic the next day, claiming in an interview with TV Nova that he would return for the trial. On November 13, 2012, the spokesperson of the Prague State Attorney's Office announced that the police had formally closed their investigation and proposed to the State Attorney to indict Blythe. After reviewing the case file, the State Attorney indicted Blythe on the aforementioned charges on November 30, 2012. Two weeks later, a judge set the trial to commence on February 4, 2013, with a plan to conduct the hearings in four consecutive days. Blythe was summoned to attend the hearing in person.

The coasts around Papa Stour have claimed numerous wrecks. In Hamnavoe, Tiptans Skerry alone has sunk Dutch, French, German and Norwegian ships. The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran A178, foundered on the Ve Skerries 3 miles northwest of Papa Stour, on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of Scalloway to land her catch. When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw, and reported the wreck. By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers (there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time), weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries. A request had been made for the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney, only 120 miles away, to launch, but the request was made too late to be of help. All 9 crew perished in the wreck. Only 3 bodies were recovered, that of James Mitchell, which was returned to Aberdeen, and the bodies of J. Cormack and J.R. Insh, which were buried in Scalloway. The cargo ship SS Highcliffe ran aground in fog on Forewick Holm in February 1940. On this occasion the conditions were clement and only the ship and cargo were lost. In 1967 the Aberdeen trawler Juniper ran aground in Lyra Sound at the bottom of the cliffs. The 12 man crew were rescued by the Aith lifeboat, the coxswain being awarded the RNLI silver medal for this rescue.

A small school was established to cater to the growing number of children, and a post office was set up to provide mail and phone services.\n\nHowever, as the village's population continued to swell, it became clear that the infrastructure was struggling to keep up. The old stone road that wound its way through the valley was often impassable during the winter months, and the few shops and services that existed were stretched to the breaking point.\n\nIt was against this backdrop of growth and challenge that the village council was formed in 1985.

This section includes a truck-restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and Riverview Cemetery. North of I-295, Route 29 turns into a scenic and mostly two-lane highway. North of the South Trenton Tunnel, it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway, a New Jersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway, that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and Hunterdon County. The obsolete Delaware & Raritan Canal usually stands between the river and the highway. Most sections of this portion of Route 29 are completely shaded due to the tree canopy. Route 29 also has a spur, Route 129, which connects Route 29 to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Trenton. Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown Trenton to Newark, following present-day Route 179 and US 202 between Lambertville and Somerville and US 22 between Somerville and Newark. The route between Lambertville and Frenchtown was originally Route 29A. In 1953, Route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of Route 29A to avoid the concurrencies with the U.S. Routes. Route 29 between South Warren Street in Trenton and I-95 (now I-295) in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four-lane highway, with a portion of freeway, in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1995, the southern freeway part of Route 29 between I-195/I-295 and Route 129 in Hamilton Township was completed. This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002. A realignment of Route 29 in Lambertville by the 2000s made the route concurrent with the entire length of Route 165. Route 29 begins at a modified cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 195 and Interstate 295 in Hamilton Township, and it serves as the western continuation of Interstate 195, heading to the northwest as a six-lane freeway. The route has an interchange with Route 129, a spur of Route 29 which connects to U.S. Route 1, with a northbound exit and southbound entrance.

The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid-1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo-boats for the defence of harbours and rivers, as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts. Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies, with the ironclad HMVS Cerberus in service from 1870, as well as the steam-sail warship on loan from the Royal Navy, three small gunboats and five torpedo-boats. New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo-boats and a corvette. The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885, while South Australia operated a single ship, HMCS Protector. Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps, while Western Australia's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery. Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900, while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action. The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901, when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia. During the early years of the 1880s, an Egyptian regime in the Sudan, backed by the British, came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad (or Ahmed), known as Mahdi to his followers. In 1883, as part of the Mahdist War, the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt, but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces. The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan, and sent General Charles Gordon to co-ordinate the evacuation, but he was killed in January 1885. When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885, the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent's expenses. The New South Wales Contingent consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers, and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885.

Meanwhile, the colonies struggled to coordinate their naval efforts, leading to concerns about national security and the vulnerability of trade routes.

On the 29th ballot, taken near the end of February 1908, Bradley finally secured a majority, after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him. Beckham's ardent support of Prohibition likely cost him the election. That put him at odds with Henry Watterson, editor of the powerful Louisville Courier-Journal. As governor Beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machine in Louisville. When the Kentucky Court of Appeals invalidated the results of Louisville's municipal elections for interference by the city's \"whiskey ring\" in May 1907, Beckham appointed Robert Worth Bingham, a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist, as the interim mayor until elections could be held in November. Bingham eliminated grafting in the police department, closed gambling houses, and enforced blue laws that closed saloons on Sunday. The whiskey ring, therefore, announced that Beckham had forfeited the support of Louisville's legislators. In the senatorial election in 1908, three of the four Democrats who voted against Beckham were from Louisville. Following his defeat, Beckham returned to his law practice. Six years later, Beckham again attempted to win back hia Senate seat. The passage of the Seventeenth Amendment meant that the Senate would no longer be elected by the legislature but instead by popular vote. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated Augustus O. Stanley, a 12-year veteran of the House of Representatives. The Republican nominee was former Governor Augustus E. Willson. Bolstered by his support of President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes. Beckham served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the US Department of Labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the US Bullion Depository. After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations. True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage.", "text1": "As the stalemate continued, tensions within the Democratic Party began to rise.

Despite his efforts to rally support for Beckham, he couldn't understand why his fellow Democrats were hesitant to back their party's senator.

Bryan took action by arranging a private meeting with the resistant senators before the seventh vote in an attempt to persuade them. However, Bryan quickly discovered that the opposition to Beckham ran deeper than he had originally thought.

They were determined to keep resisting unless Bryan could persuade Beckham to adopt a more progressive position on important issues.

This action resulted in the capture of over 1,000 Boer prisoners and the destruction of several artillery pieces.\n\nThroughout the spring and summer of 1900, the Queenslanders and New South Wales Lancers continued to play a vital role in the war, conducting reconnaissance missions, patrols, and raids deep behind Boer lines.

As a result, a number of high-ranking Boer officials, including Commandant-General Piet Joubert, began secretly negotiating a peace treaty with the British.\n\nBy the end of February, the British forces had captured the strategic town of Warmbad, and were closing in on the Boer stronghold of Kroonstad.

During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded, while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count, 60 possibly killed, 7 wounded and 11 captured. Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969, Hat Dich in late-December 1968 and early 1969 and Long Khanh in June 1971. At the height of the Australian commitment, 1 ATF numbered 8,500 troops, including three infantry battalions, armour, artillery, engineers, logistics and aviation units in support. A third RAAF unit, No. 2 Squadron RAAF, flying Canberra bombers, was sent in 1967, and four RAN destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam. The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November 1970. As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal, and 1 ATF ceased operations in October. Meanwhile, the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of Gough Whitlam. The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973. The Vietnam War was Australia's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support, as the nation's military involvement increased a vocal anti-war movement developed. More than 50,000 Australians served in Vietnam; 519 were killed and 2,398 were wounded. Four were awarded the Victoria Cross. Although the importance of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War.", "text1": "As the situation in Phuoc Tuy stabilized, the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) began to shift its focus towards supporting the larger Allied effort to secure the vital city of Saigon. In late 1967, 1 ATF was tasked with conducting operations along the infiltration routes leading into the city, with the aim of disrupting the flow of communist supplies and troops. This assignment was part of Operation Coburg, a broader Allied operation designed to protect Saigon from the impending Tet Offensive.\n\nIn early 1968, 1 ATF played a key role in defending the capital against the communist forces that launched a surprise attack on the city during the Tet Offensive. The Australians fought bravely alongside their American and South Vietnamese allies, repelling multiple attacks and inflicting significant casualties on the enemy.\n\nIn May and June of the same year, 1 ATF was once again in the thick of the action, this time during the Battle of Coral-Balmoral. This intense battle saw Australian forces clash with the enemy in a series of fierce firefights, with both sides suffering heavy losses. Despite being outnumbered, the Australians held their ground, eventually forcing the enemy to withdraw from the area.\n\nThe experience of fighting in Saigon and during the Battle of Coral-Balmoral marked a significant turning point for the Australians in Vietnam. The battles had shown that they were more than capable of holding their own against the enemy, and that they were a valuable asset to the Allied forces fighting in South Vietnam. As the war dragged on, the Australians would continue to play a crucial role in supporting the South Vietnamese government and defending against the communist insurgency.", "text2": "As the summer of 1968 drew to a close, the Australians began to shift their attention back to their traditional area of operation in Phuoc Tuy. The 1 ATF had played a crucial role in supporting the South Vietnamese forces during the Tet Offensive, and their efforts had helped to blunt the communist thrust towards Saigon. However, the Australians knew that the fighting was far from over, and that the VC would continue to launch guerrilla attacks against their personnel and installations throughout the province.\n\nTo counter this, the Australians launched a series of large-scale operations aimed at finding and destroying VC base camps and supply networks. The first of these, Operation Longdent, took place in late July 1968, and involved the largest single operation conducted by Australian forces to that date. Over three weeks, more than 10,000 Australian, New Zealand, and South Vietnamese troops combed the countryside in Phuoc Tuy, searching for signs of VC activity.\n\nWhile the Australians did not achieve a decisive victory during Longdent, the operation had some significant benefits. Firstly, it allowed the Australians to re-establish a strong presence in the north of the province, which had been weakened earlier in the year as they had focused their efforts further south. Secondly, it put pressure on the VC, making it harder for them to regroup and refit after the Tet Offensive.\n\nThe success of Operation Longdent was soon replicated with Operation Camden Town, which took place in September and October 1968. During this operation, the Australians, once again in conjunction with their South Vietnamese allies, uncovered several significant VC base camps and supply points, and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy.

In response, the Australians initiated a number of extensive operations with the goal of locating and eliminating VC base camps and supply routes. Operation Longdent, the initial operation, occurred in late July 1968 and was the biggest operation carried out by Australian forces up to that point. For a period of three weeks, Australian, New Zealand, and South Vietnamese troops conducted thorough searches in Phuoc Tuy to locate any indications of VC presence. Although the Australians did not win decisively during Longdent, the operation did have notable advantages. Initially, it enabled the Australians to strengthen their position in the northern part of the province, which had been compromised due to their previous focus on the southern areas. Additionally, it created difficulties for the VC in regrouping and rearming following the Tet Offensive. Operation Camden Town, which occurred in September and October 1968, followed the success of Operation Longdent. In this operation, the Australians, working alongside their South Vietnamese partners, discovered important VC base camps and supply points, and caused significant losses to the enemy.

{"prefix": "Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them.", "gold": "On occasions large groups of Aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the Aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aborigines than the Europeans. Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms. However, the advantages afforded by firearms have often been overstated. Prior to the late 19th century, firearms were often cumbersome muzzle-loading, smooth-bore, single shot muskets with flint-lock mechanisms. Such weapons produced a low rate of fire, while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within . These deficiencies may have initially given the Aborigines an advantage, allowing them to move in close and engage with spears or clubs. Yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage, with the six-shot Colt revolver, the Snider single shot breech-loading rifle and later the Martini-Henry rifle, as well as rapid-fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle, becoming available. These weapons, when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of Aborigines, often proved successful. The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast-moving, often hidden enemies. Tactics employed included night-time surprise attacks, and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks. The conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia. Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May 1788, it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s. As the frontier moved west so did the conflict, pushing into outback New South Wales in the 1840s. In Tasmania, fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s, while in Victoria and the southern parts of South Australia, the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s. The south-west of Western Australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850.", "text1": "However, the settlers' perception of the Aborigines as a threat was deeply ingrained and influenced their actions towards them. Many settlers believed that the Aboriginal people were inherently violent and savage, and this belief was often used to justify the dispossession of their land and the suppression of their culture. The fear of Aboriginal attacks was also used to rationalize the brutal treatment of Aboriginal people, including the use of forced relocation, forced labor, and violence.\n\nDespite the lack of a serious military threat, the settlers continued to view the Aborigines as a problem that needed to be managed. They saw the Aboriginal people as a barrier to their own progress and development, and believed that they needed to be removed or assimilated into European culture. This mentality was perpetuated by the colonial governments, which implemented policies aimed at suppressing Aboriginal culture and reducing their numbers.\n\nThe impact of these policies was devastating for the Aboriginal people. They were forcibly removed from their land, their culture was suppressed, and many were subjected to forced labor and violence. The effects of these policies can still be seen today, with many Aboriginal people struggling to regain their cultural identity and overcome the legacies of colonization.", "text2": "In fact, many European settlers often relied on the assistance of Aboriginal guides and trackers to navigate the uncharted territories and locate mineral deposits and water sources. The Aboriginal people's deep understanding of the land, their traditional tracking techniques, and their knowledge of the native plants and animals proved invaluable to the newcomers. As a result, many relationships were formed between Aboriginal people and settlers, with individuals like Benjamin Singleton, a pioneering farmer, forming close bonds with local Aboriginal men, who would go on to work as his guides and workers on his property.\n\nAdditionally, the Australian colonial administration recognized the need to establish formalized relationships with the Aboriginal people, and in the late 1820s, the British Government began to develop policies aimed at \"assimilation\" - a approach which aimed to teach Aboriginal people European customs and values, and to eventually assimilate them into the broader white Australian society. While these policies would ultimately fail to bring about the desired outcome, they represented an important recognition of the need to engage with Aboriginal people and to work towards coexistence.\n\nMeanwhile, the presence of firearms among the Aboriginal people was often the result of trade or raids on remote settlements, where firearms were occasionally misplaced or left behind. While some Aboriginal people may have used guns to hunt and defend themselves, it's clear that these weapons were never widespread or integral to their traditional way of life, and that their cultural practices and values were shaped by a fundamentally non-violent worldview.", "text3": "European settlers frequently depended on Aboriginal guides and trackers to help them navigate unknown lands and find resources like minerals and water. Newcomers greatly benefited from the Aboriginal people's expertise in navigating the land and identifying resources. This led to the development of close relationships between settlers and Aboriginal people, such as Benjamin Singleton, who employed local Aboriginal men as guides and workers on his farm. The Australian colonial administration also saw the importance of forming official connections with the Aboriginal people, leading to the implementation of assimilation policies by the British Government in the late 1820s. Although the assimilation policies did not achieve their intended goals, they did acknowledge the importance of engaging with Aboriginal people and striving for peaceful coexistence. Aboriginal people sometimes acquired firearms through trade or raids on remote settlements, where they were sometimes abandoned or lost. Although some Aboriginal individuals may have utilized firearms for hunting and protection, it is evident that these weapons were not commonly used or essential to their traditional lifestyle, which was influenced by a fundamentally peaceful perspective.", "detect1": {"z_score": -1.3757557423688787, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.45493562231759654, "p_value": 0.915551366127684}, "detect2": {"z_score": 9.545941546018392, "prediction": true, "green_fraction": 0.78125, "p_value": 6.743839446805552e-22}, "detect3": {"z_score": 2.76463669953251, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.5979899497487438, "p_value": 0.0028493112166783964}, "curr_idx": 288}

Bail was deposited in the court's bank account on mid-day of July 3, 2012. After this, the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint. Due to public holidays it was not until July 9, 2012, that the State Attorney filed his complaint, which was to be dealt with by appellate court, the Prague Municipal Court. On July 17, 2012, Prague Municipal Court's panel of three judges headed by judge Lubo\u0161 Vrba overturned the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to CZK 8 million (~ US$ 400,000). After this, the State Attorney challenged the conditions of release, trying to achieve that the bail is subject to Blythe staying in the country and/or Blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished.

The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern-sympathizing area and close to the Confederate state of Arkansas and the \"unstable\" Indian Territory (present-day state of Oklahoma), where many of the members of the Five Civilized Tribes were allied with the Confederates. The fort served as a \"general hospital\" (large military hospital) and prison until after the war. Following the end of the war, in October 1865 the US Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled. On January 14, 1870, the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas. The Post was based at Fort Scott, but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks, and seldom used the original fort. They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers. Some of the latter feared that the railroad, which had been awarded land for development by the US Government in rights-of-way, would evict them from their squatter homes. The settlers considered the troops lackeys to the railroads, and lumped both as enemies. Settlers also had some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurgents using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery. By the spring of 1873, the US Army withdrew the troops from Fort Scott for good. From 1873 to 1965, the buildings of the fort were left unattended, and slowly deteriorated. Many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use. With the Act of August 31, 1965, the National Park Service gave the city government of Fort Scott, Kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort.

Douglass delivered a stirring speech to the men of the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry, urging them to fight for their freedom and the freedom of their fellow African Americans. His words were met with thunderous applause, and the men of the regiment marched out of the fort, inspired by his words, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.\n\nAs the war drew to a close, Fort Scott continued to play a crucial role in the war effort, serving as a major supply depot and training center for the U.S. Army.

He had previously starred alongside Carell, in the 2004 film, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. The cut scenes include a sequence in which Michael and Deangelo discuss cancer jokes and the 2010 film Megamind\u2014an animated film that featured the voice of Ferrell\u2014while drinking vodka, shots of Michael and Deangelo discussing their enjoyment for coffee, and Dwight attempting to appease his new boss. In its original American broadcast, \"Training Day\" was viewed by an estimated 7.871 million viewers and received a 4.0 rating/11% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 4.0% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast.

It was almost as if... well, it was almost as if Deangelo had actually been trying to make amends.\n\nJust then, Dwight Beckett, the office's resident eccentric, burst into the conference room, holding a small plant in his hand. \"Andy, I've brought the lucky bamboo you requested for the meeting,\" he announced, his voice low and gravelly.\n\nDeangelo's eyes lit up. \"Ah, perfect timing, Dwight! We were just discussing the importance of office morale. And what better way to boost morale than with a little greenery?\"\n\nMichael, who had been watching the exchange with growing unease, suddenly had an idea.

Who knows, maybe we can even start a new office trend - 'Lucky Bamboo Fridays'! Am I right, guys?\"\n\nThe room fell silent, with Deangelo's face darkening in suspicion. Dwight, however, seemed delighted, nodding enthusiastically. \"Yes, yes, this is a capital idea, Michael!\"\n\nAs the camera rolled, Michael couldn't help but feel a twinge of satisfaction.

Just as he is about to intervene and put an end to the cacophony, the supply closet door swings open, and Deangelo bursts out, grinning widely, singing and dancing to the strains of the song.\n\n\"Hey, buddy! I just wanted to share the joy!\" he booms, completely oblivious to the chaos he has just unleashed upon the rest of the office.\n\nMichael facepalms, simultaneously embarrassed on behalf of Deangelo's coworkers and delighted that his former HR employee is still so endearingly...

This addition allowed for increased presence and capability in the region, particularly in the mountainous and rural areas where the Taliban were known to be active.\n\nIn addition to the expanded Mentoring Task Force, the Special Operations Task Group also continued to play a critical role in the campaign. They conducted a range of operations, including special reconnaissance, direct action, and training missions with Afghan National Army units. The group's expertise in unconventional warfare and counter-terrorism was particularly valuable in Uruzgan, where the Taliban's network of insurgents was highly dispersed and mobile.\n\nThe Rotary Wing Group continued to provide critical air support to ground forces, with the CH-47D Chinooks being used to transport troops, supplies, and equipment over the difficult terrain of Uruzgan Province. The helicopters also played a key role in medical evacuations and casualty extraction, with the group's medics and crew chiefs receiving extensive training in emergency medical procedures.\n\nMeanwhile, the Force Logistics Asset worked tirelessly to maintain the force's equipment and supplies, often under challenging conditions.

This upgrade allowed for more efficient and effective management of air assets, and improved the force's ability to respond quickly to emerging threats.\n\nThroughout 2011 and 2012, the force continued to work closely with Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police units, conducting combined operations and training exercises to build their capacity and capability.

The Mentoring Task Force was disbanded, and its personnel reorganized into a number of smaller teams that would advise and assist ANSF battalion commanders and their headquarters. The Special Operations Task Group continued to play a key role in counter-terrorism operations, often working closely with US special forces to target and disrupt Taliban networks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Australian aviation assets continued to play a crucial role in the campaign, providing transport, reconnaissance, and casualty evacuation capabilities in support of Australian troops and their Afghan partners. The Rotary Wing Group had expanded its fleet to include Chinooks and Black Hawks, and was now responsible for transporting not only Australian personnel, but also Afghan soldiers and government officials.\n\nThroughout the conflict, the Australian force faced a number of challenges, including harsh weather conditions, ongoing security threats from improvised explosive devices and insider attacks, and logistical challenges due to the remote and mountainous terrain. Despite these challenges, the force consistently performed at a high level, earning praise from both Afghan and international commanders for its adaptability, flexibility, and commitment to the campaign.\n\nBy the time of the Australian withdrawal from Afghanistan in late 2021, the force had played a significant role in the country's transition, having trained and advised thousands of Afghan soldiers and police officers, and contributed to the defeat of the Islamic State (IS) insurgency that had emerged in the region.", "text3": "The ongoing presence of the force in the area demonstrated the strong partnership between the Australian Defence Force and its international allies, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and NATO forces.

Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000.", "gold": "The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred. Scientology formulated a \"Clear Germany\" strategy in 1994 \u2013 similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world \u2013 with the long-term aim of transforming German society in line with the Scientological ideal: a non-pluralist society in which Scientology enjoys overriding influence. The programme sought to address Scientology's image problems in Germany, to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain, such as Germany's National Socialist history, and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society, with a special emphasis on manoeuvring Scientologists into key positions in industry and government. As most religions seek to widen their influence in society, such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort, much like those many religions engage in. However, according to the BfV, the strategy has not had any significant success. By 1998, 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed, but apart from some isolated cases, most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology. According to Fifka & Sydora (2009), it is unknown to what degree the \"Clear Germany\" programme is still being pursued. German public discourse does not regard Scientology as a religion, but generally characterizes it as a Sekte (cult or sect), or as an exploitative profit-making venture preying on vulnerable minds.", "text1": "The BfV has been monitoring the activities of Scientology in Germany since the 1970s, and has repeatedly expressed concerns about the group's methods and ideology. In 1995, the German government passed a law known as the \"Gesetz zur Bek\u00e4mpfung des religi\u00f6sen Missbrauchs\" (Law against Religious Abuse), which prohibits the use of psychological manipulation and coercion by religious groups. The law was specifically aimed at Scientology, which critics have accused of using these tactics to recruit and retain members.\n\nDespite the law, Scientology has continued to operate in Germany and has even expanded its presence in recent years. The group has been involved in several high-profile disputes with the German government and other organizations, including a long-standing feud with the Association of German Psychologists, which has accused Scientology of spreading false and misleading information about psychology and psychiatry.\n\nIn addition to its legal and political challenges, Scientology has also faced criticism from some of its own former members, who have spoken out about their experiences in the group and the negative effects it has had on their lives. These former members have formed their own support groups and advocacy organizations, which aim to educate the public about the dangers of Scientology and to help those who have been affected by the group.\n\nOverall, Scientology remains a controversial and controversial organization in Germany, with some people viewing it as a legitimate religious group and others seeing it as a cult or a dangerous and harmful influence.", "text2": "The decline in numbers has been attributed to increased legal challenges and public scrutiny faced by Scientology organizations in Germany. Despite this, the Church remains prominent, with a strong presence in major cities like Berlin and Munich. The Church's headquarters are situated in Hamburg, where the organization's German leader, Ursula Candessa, is based. Candessa has been critical of the government's handling of Scientology, claiming discrimination and unfair treatment.\n\nMany of the Church's independent associations in Germany have been involved in controversy, with allegations of harassment, intimidation, and physical confrontations directed towards critics, including journalists, activists, and ex-followers. The Church denies these allegations, describing them as part of a broader conspiracy to discredit the organization. However, the cases have led to several investigations and criminal charges, further damaging the Church's public reputation.\n\nIn recent years, the Church's financial situation has become increasingly strained. Charitable donations, a key revenue stream, have dwindled due to public skepticism and declining membership. As a result, the Church has been forced to rely more heavily on fundraising efforts and donations from international members, a trend that has led to concerns about the organization's financial accountability.\n\nDespite the challenges, the Church remains influential in German society, with many followers maintaining high-level positions in politics, media, and industry. The Church's influence has been credited with shaping Germany's attitudes towards healthcare, mental health, and human rights, often in ways that critics say are at odds with the country's liberal and progressive values.", "text3": "The decrease in numbers is believed to be caused by the rise in legal challenges and public scrutiny that Scientology organizations in Germany are facing.

Candessa has expressed disapproval of how the government is dealing with Scientology, alleging discrimination and unjust actions.

The Church refutes the accusations, claiming they are part of a larger plot to undermine the organization. Nevertheless, the Church's public reputation has been further tarnished by investigations and criminal charges resulting from the cases. The Church has been facing financial difficulties in recent years. Public doubt and a decrease in membership have led to a reduction in charitable contributions, which are an important source of income.

It was released in North America on June 23, 1991, and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month. Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles, replacing Altered Beast. This tactic enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail. Sega of America created a marketing campaign, making Sonic its new mascot. A version of Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by Ancient and released in late 1991 for Sega's 8-bit consoles, the Master System and Game Gear. Its plot and gameplay mechanics are similar to the 16-bit version, though some level themes and digital assets are different and Chaos Emeralds are scattered throughout levels rather than special stages.

Daniel Lanois, the producer of the Joshua Tree album, played a memorable piano riff in the song. Critics praised the sonic landscape and emotional impact of \"Where the Streets Have No Name.\" \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was a successful song for U2, peaking at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and winning two Grammy Awards in 1988, including Record of the Year. The song has gained popularity among fans and is regularly performed by U2 during their live concerts. Critics have lauded the song for its atmospheric and mood-setting qualities, often considering it one of U2's top tracks. The song has appeared in various TV shows and movies, such as The Office, Parks and Recreation, and The Social Network.

During his term as SASO, the RAAF began re-equipping with English Electric Canberra jet bombers and CAC Sabre jet fighters. The Air Force also underwent a major organisational change, as it transitioned from a geographically based command-and-control system to one based on function, resulting in the establishment of Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. Eastern Area Command, considered a de facto operational headquarters owing to the preponderance of combat units under its control, was reorganised as Home Command in October 1953. Headlam was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1954 New Year Honours for his \"exceptional ability and devotion to duty\". He was promoted to acting air commodore in May. His appointment as aide-de-camp to Queen Elizabeth II was announced on 7 October 1954.

The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment, however. She opened with Alexander's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin, then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson, and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin: I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise, Innocent Ing\u00e9nue Baby, and Swanee. Gershwin played the piano for these pieces. Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Virgil Thomson, and Paul Whiteman. Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music, the performance was overall a huge success, and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art. Gauthier continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences. On some occasions, such as her performances of Gershwin in New York in 1923 and 1925, as well as in London in 1925, this was quite successful.

A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made. The long stocks were made from Douglas fir. All timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned. It was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to 20% stronger than a similar stock of solid timber. The timber used was thick and nine laminations were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft. Careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber. Both stocks were made during the work-in, with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use.

The average annual rainfall at Tikal is . However, the arrival of rain was often unpredictable, and long period of drought could occur before the crops ripen, which severely threatened the inhabitants of the city. Population estimates for Tikal vary from 10,000 to as high as 90,000 inhabitants. The population of Tikal began a continuous curve of growth starting in the Preclassic Period (approximately 2000 BC \u2013 AD 200), with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830, followed by a sharp decline. For the area falling within the earthwork defenses of the hinterland, the peak population is estimated at 517 per square kilometer (1340 per square mile). In an area within a radius of the site core, peak population is estimated at 120,000; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer (689 per square mile). In a region within a radius of the site core and including some satellite sites, peak population is estimated at 425,000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer (515 per square mile). These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive swamplands that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture. However, some archaeologists, such as David Webster, believe these figures to be far too high. The dynastic line of Tikal, founded as early as the 1st century AD, spanned 800 years and included at least 33 rulers. There are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as 1000 BC, in the Middle Preclassic. A cache of Mamon ceramics dating from about 700-400 BC were found in a sealed chultun, a subterranean bottle-shaped chamber. Major construction at Tikal was already taking place in the Late Preclassic period, first appearing around 400\u2013300 BC, including the building of major pyramids and platforms, although the city was still dwarfed by sites further north such as El Mirador and Nakbe. At this time, Tikal participated in the widespread Chikanel culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time \u2013 a region that included the entire Yucatan Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize. Two temples dating to Late Chikanel times had masonry-walled superstructures that may have been corbel-vaulted, although this has not been proven.

The air was thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the distant call of howler monkeys. It was as if the jungle itself was awakening, and the spirits of the past were stirring, waiting to be discovered by those who dared to venture into the depths of Tikal.", "text2": "The ancient Mayans believed that the lack of natural water sources had given the park its mystical powers, and that the reservoirs held not only rainwater, but also the essence of the gods.

{"prefix": "In a molecular study of the large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the orchid Gastrodia confusa, M. inclinata was found to be closely related to M. aurantiomarginata, M. crocata, and M. leaiana. The specific epithet inclinata means \"bent in\".", "gold": "The mushroom is commonly known as the \"clustered bonnet\" or the \"oak-stump bonnet cap\". The cap is light reddish-brown, with a diameter typically ranging from . Initially conic to bell-shaped to convex, it flattens during maturity, developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap. The margin of the cap has minute but distinct scallops. The surface is moist and smooth, and hygrophanous. The cap frequently develops splits in the margin, or cracks in the disc (the central part of the cap). The flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere, grayish to whitish, fragile, and with a slightly mealy odor and taste. The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stem (that is, running down the length of the stem) and are a pale brownish color with tinges of red. They are broad (between 3 and 6 mm), and have a close to subdistant spacing, with about 26\u201335 gills reaching the stem. The fragile stem is long by thick and yellow to yellow-brown, becoming reddish-brown to orange-brown in the bottom half in maturity. The lower portion of young stems is covered with white flecks. Roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom, the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem. The edibility of the mushroom is \"doubtful\" and consumption \"best avoided\". The spores are 7\u20139 by 5\u20136.5 \u03bcm, broadly ellipsoid, smooth, and strongly amyloid (it turns black when treated with Melzer's reagent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not differentiated. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are embedded in the gill edge and very inconspicuous, club-shaped, 26\u201336 by 5\u201310 \u03bcm, and have tips that are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick.", "text1": "Further analysis of the molecular data revealed that M. inclinata formed a distinct clade with the aforementioned species, which was supported by high bootstrap values. This clustering suggested that these species may have shared a common ancestor relatively recently in evolutionary history. The close relationship between M. inclinata and the other three species was also reflected in their morphological characteristics, with all four species sharing similar features such as their habit of growing on the roots of monocots and their yellowish-brown to reddish-brown coloration.\n\nDespite their close phylogenetic relationship, M. inclinata was distinguished from its sister species by its unique habit of growing in a bent or curved shape, which was not observed in the other three species. This distinctive morphology was thought to be an adaptation to the specific microhabitat in which M. inclinata grows, which is often characterized by tight spaces and crevices.\n\nThe finding of M. inclinata in association with Gastrodia confusa was also significant, as it suggested that this species may play an important role in the mycorrhizal relationships of the orchid. Further research is needed to fully understand the interactions between M. inclinata and G. confusa, and to determine the ecological and evolutionary significance of their association.", "text2": "Further characterization of the species revealed unique morphological features that supported its close genetic relationship to the other three species mentioned. The fungus was found to possess slender, almost translucent hyphae with a tendency to grow in sinuous, bending patterns on the substratum, a characteristic that was inconsistent with the other species in the group. The spores of M. inclinata were similarly distinguished by their oval shape and distinctly wrinkled appearance. Examination of the species in vitro and under laboratory conditions also revealed differences in its capacity for nutrient uptake and degradation of cellulose and chitin compared to the other species. These distinct traits provided strong evidence that the species was valid and warranted a unique taxonomic designation.", "text3": "Additional analysis of the species showed distinct physical characteristics that confirmed its genetic similarity to the other three species referenced. The fungus had unique physical features, such as thin, nearly see-through hyphae that grew in twisting patterns on the surface, which set it apart from the other species.

{"prefix": "Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BCE, Tikal reached its apogee during the Classic Period, c. 200 to 900 CE. During this time, the city dominated much of the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily, while interacting with areas throughout Mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico.", "gold": "There is evidence that Tikal was conquered by Teotihuacan in the 4th century CE. Following the end of the Late Classic Period, no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned. These events were coupled with a gradual population decline, culminating with the site's abandonment by the end of the 10th century. Tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities, with a long dynastic ruler list, the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments, temples and palaces. The name Tikal may be derived from ti ak'al in the Yucatec Maya language; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning \"at the waterhole\". The name was apparently applied to one of the site's ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region. It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning \"the place of the voices\" in the Itza Maya language. Tikal, however, is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the 1840s. Hieroglyphic inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as Yax Mutal or Yax Mutul, meaning \"First Mutal\". Tikal may have come to have been called this because Dos Pilas also came to use the same emblem glyph; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name. The kingdom as a whole was simply called Mutul, which is the reading of the \"hair bundle\" emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo. Its precise meaning remains obscure. The closest large modern settlements are Flores and Santa Elena, approximately by road to the southwest. Tikal is approximately north of Guatemala City. It is south of the contemporary Maya city of Uaxactun and northwest of Yaxha. The city was located southeast of its great Classic Period rival, Calakmul, and northwest of Calakmul's ally Caracol, now in Belize. The city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than that included about 3,000 structures. The topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands.", "text1": "As the Classic Period reached its zenith, Tikal's rulers, known as the Ajaw, oversaw a golden age of culture, art, and engineering. The city's architecture, characterized by towering pyramids and grand plazas, was a testament to their power and influence. The legendary Temple I, also known as the Temple of the Grand Jaguar, stood as a symbol of the city's grandeur, its intricate carvings and hieroglyphics telling the story of Tikal's history and mythology.\n\nDespite its dominance, however, Tikal's influence began to wane around the 9th century CE, as a combination of factors, including drought, war, and internal strife, led to a decline in the city's population and economy. The once-mighty capital of the Maya region fell into a period of obscurity, its grand architecture crumbling into the jungle.\n\nIt would remain this way for centuries, until the arrival of Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century CE. The conquistadors, led by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, stumbled upon the ruins of Tikal in the midst of the jungle, marveling at the grandeur of the ancient city. Though the Spanish would eventually claim the region for themselves, the discovery of Tikal would spark a renewed interest in the ancient Maya civilization, paving the way for archaeologists and historians to unravel the secrets of this enigmatic and fascinating culture.", "text2": "As the Classic Period drew to a close, the city began to experience a decline in power and population. The causes of this downfall are still debated among scholars, but it's believed that a combination of factors such as drought, overexploitation of natural resources, and conflicts with rival city-states contributed to Tikal's decline. The once-mighty metropolis was eventually abandoned, and its population scattered into the surrounding jungles.\n\nCenturies passed, and the city lay in ruin, hidden beneath the encroaching foliage. It wasn't until the late 19th century that Tikal began to re-emerge from its tropical tomb. Archaeologists and explorers arrived on the scene, drawn by rumors of the ancient city and its spectacular Mayan ruins. The first excavations commenced, and as the archaeologists uncovered more and more artifacts, it became clear that Tikal held many secrets and mysteries waiting to be unraveled.\n\nToday, the ancient city of Tikal is a testament to the enduring power of human creativity and ingenuity, a window into the vibrant culture of the ancient Maya, and a source of fascination and inspiration for people from around the world.", "text3": "The city's power and population started to decrease as the Classic Period ended. Scholars are still discussing the reasons for Tikal's decline, with some attributing it to a mix of factors like drought, overuse of resources, and conflicts with other city-states. The powerful city was eventually deserted, and its inhabitants dispersed into the nearby forests. Over time, the city deteriorated and was covered by growing vegetation. Tikal didn't start to resurface until the late 19th century. Researchers and adventurers came to the area after hearing about the ancient city and its impressive Mayan remains. As archaeologists began digging, they discovered that Tikal was hiding numerous secrets and mysteries just waiting to be uncovered.

The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports (Prome, Dala and Bassein), the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome. Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of Pegu revolted that same year. The king managed to send two small expeditions to Pegu but they both failed. Now, the entire eastern half of Lower Burma (Pegu and Martaban) was in open revolt. Given his precarious position, Narathihapate decided to buy time, and sue for peace with the Mongols. In November/December 1285, the king ordered his generals Ananda Pyissi and Maha Bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations. The Mongol commanders at Hanlin, who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named Zhengmian (), agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission. They repeated their 1281 demand that the Burmese king send a formal delegation to the emperor. The two sides had reached a tentative agreement by 3 March 1286, which calls for a full submission of the Pagan Empire, and central Burma to be organized as the province of Mianzhong (). After a long deliberation, the king agreed to submit but wanted the Mongol troops to withdraw. In June 1286, he sent an embassy led by Shin Ditha Pamauk, a learned monk, to the emperor's court. In January 1287, the embassy arrived at Beijing, and was received by the Yuan emperor. The Burmese delegation formally acknowledged Mongol suzerainty of their kingdom, and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country. (Indeed, the tribute was no longer nominal.) In exchange, the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops. For the emperor, the Burma campaign was the only bright spot; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly. He did not want to invest more troops pacify the rest of the kingdom. He preferred a vassal ruler.", "text1": "As the news of the defeat spread, panic and chaos erupted throughout the kingdom.

The once-mighty Burmese kingdom was on the brink of collapse.\n\nMeanwhile, the king, still reeling from the shock of defeat, took refuge in the isolated stronghold of Hanlin, where he was surrounded by a small group of loyal guards. He knew that if the Mon forces discovered his whereabouts, he would be captured or killed, and so he remained hidden, sending out messengers to his loyal generals, begging them to come to his aid.\n\nBut the Mon forces were relentless, and soon, they had surrounded Hanlin, trapping the king and his guards. The king, realizing that his time was running out, sent out a final message to his generals, ordering them to surrender and negotiate a peace treaty with the Mon. It was a desperate bid to save what was left of his kingdom, but it would likely be too late.", "text2": "As the Chinese armies advanced towards Pagan, the King of Burma, thinking he had lost the battle, abandoned his capital and fled to the southern city of Martaban in Lower Burma.

Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size. Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female, whose shell is therefore soft, and a hard-shelled male. The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months, depending on the temperature, attached to her pleopods. Females carrying eggs are said to be \"berried\" and can be found throughout the year. The eggs hatch at night, and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15\u201335 days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a benthic lifestyle. The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild, and are poorly known, although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows. It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20,000 survives to the benthic phase. When they reach a carapace length of , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives. Homarus gammarus is found across the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco, not including the Baltic Sea. It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea, only missing from the section east of Crete, and along only the north-west coast of the Black Sea. The northernmost populations are found in the Norwegian fjords Tysfjorden and Nordfolda, inside the Arctic Circle. The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations, one widespread population, and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes, possibly due to adaptation to the local environment. The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway, which have been referred to as the \"midnight-sun lobster\". The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean. The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands: samples from the Oosterschelde were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel.", "text1": "In addition to these visual differences, the two species also exhibit distinct behavioral patterns. Hermit crabs of the species H. americanus are known to be more aggressive and territorial, often engaging in fierce battles over resources and shelter. In contrast, H. gammarus are generally more docile and will often coexist peacefully in close proximity. Furthermore, H. americanus are more likely to venture out of their shells at night, while H. gammarus tend to remain hidden and secure within their shells for longer periods. These behavioral differences are thought to be adaptations to their respective environments, with H. americanus inhabiting areas with more intense competition for resources and H. gammarus living in areas with more stable and predictable conditions.", "text2": "Additionally, the coloration of the two species differs significantly. The body of H. americanus is a mottled brown and yellow, providing excellent camouflage in its native environments. In contrast, H. gammarus has a more uniform blue-grey coloration that allows it to blend in with its algal-rich surroundings. The shape of the abdomen also differs between the two species, with H. americanus having a more pointed tail region and H. gammarus having a rounded one.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the eyes of the two species can also be used for identification purposes. The eyes of H. americanus have a distinctive orange-brown rim surrounding the iris, while those of H. gammarus have a more subdued grey-brown rim.

Tamura's attack hit Company B of the Marine Parachute battalion and also Raider Company B, pushing the Parachutists off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the ridgeline. To protect the exposed Raider Company B, Edson immediately ordered them to pull back onto Hill 123. At the same time, a Japanese company from Watanabe's battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C.

However, the relentless pressure eventually told, and Company B's line began to waver.

The yellow mycelium on the stem of the mushroom may either spread or shrink as the mushroom dries out. Delicate strands resembling fine golden hairs can be revealed by gently separating the mycelium with a finger or knife blade. Handle the mushroom with care due to its delicate texture and sensitivity to moisture, which can result in bruising or tearing. The mushroom's worth is not based on its looks, but rather on its medicinal and culinary applications.

Reviewing The Joshua Tree, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an \"epic opener\". The service's Steve Huey, in a review of the song, praised its \"insistent, propulsive rhythmic drive and anthemic chorus\", qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite. He called the song the \"perfect album-opener\", crediting the \"slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak\". Huey also called Bono's delivery \"passionate and grandiose\" and \"his commitment to the material unshakable\". He believed the combination of his vocals and the band's \"sonic power\" is what gave U2 its \"tremendous force\". \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" made its concert debut on 2 April 1987 at Arizona State University Activity Center in Tempe, Arizona on the opening night of The Joshua Tree Tour. A version featuring an extended introduction was performed on the closing nights of the third leg of The Joshua Tree tour, again in Tempe, Arizona, on December 19 & 20, 1987, and footage from the performance was featured in the Rattle and Hum film. The song has since been played at nearly every full-length concert that U2 has headlined, totaling upwards of 900 performances . The song is widely regarded as one of the group's most popular live songs. Bono said of it, \"We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives, but when we go into that song, everything changes. The audience is on its feet, singing along with every word. It's like God suddenly walks through the room.\" On The Joshua Tree Tour, \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was most often used to open concerts. Fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting. The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote that, \"From the lofty sonic opening strains of [the song], this audience was up, ecstatic and inflamed.\" NME wrote that the song is one such occasion where \"the power afforded their songs is scary\", noting that during the song's opening, \"the arena ERUPTS\".

His words, a desperate prayer to the unknown, are delivered with a conviction that shakes the very foundations of the song.\n\nThe music finally subsides, leaving only the faintest echo of the guitars and Bono's anguished cry. The final notes linger, a haunting whispered promise that the song will return, like a ghostly presence, haunting the listener long after the music has faded away.

In 682, Jasaw Chan K'awiil I erected the first dated monument at Tikal in 120 years and claimed the title of kaloomte, so ending the hiatus. He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on Calakmul when, in 695, he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered. After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory. By the 7th century, there was no active Teotihuacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had been razed by 700. Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style. Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today. In 738, Quirigu\u00e1, a vassal of Cop\u00e1n, Tikal's key ally in the south, switched allegiance to Calakmul, defeated Cop\u00e1n and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Cop\u00e1n. In the 8th century, the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis. By the late 8th century and early 9th century, activity at Tikal slowed. Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers.

He had implemented a series of reforms, including a new system of taxation and a reorganization of the city's military, which had brought a measure of stability and prosperity to the city. But despite his successes, Jasaw Chan K'awiil I knew that he was not safe, and that the rivalries and power struggles that had plagued Tikal for centuries could erupt again at any moment. He spent much of his time securing alliances with neighboring cities and preparing for the possibility of war.\n\nLittle did Jasaw Chan K'awiil I know, however, that B'alaj Chan K'awiil and K'uk' B'alam were even now preparing to strike, their armies gathered at the borders of Tikal, ready to unleash a devastating war that would shake the foundations of the Mayan city-states.

With this new allies, B'alaj Chan K'awiil returned to Dos Pilas and launched a surprise attack on Tikal, catching its rulers off guard.\n\nSupported by his allies from Naranjo, B'alaj Chan K'awiil swiftly regained control of Dos Pilas and set his sights on Tikal once again. The ruler of Tikal, sensing the weakness of the city, declined to engage in another brutal battle, and instead offered B'alaj Chan K'awiil a peace treaty and a share of power.\n\nBy the time B'alaj Chan K'awiil accepted the offer, he had amassed a formidable force at Dos Pilas, and his presence in Tikal became less a welcome negotiator and more a strong-armed overseer, installed to ensure the city obeyed his will.

The Temple I, also known as the Temple of the Grand Jaguar, is a highly recognizable and well-maintained building that showcases detailed carvings and stuccoed walls depicting the history and myths of Tikal. However, the history of Tikal continues beyond the downfall of the Classic Maya civilization. For centuries after being abandoned in the 10th century, the site remained a mystery, concealed by the advancing jungle. In the mid-20th century, archaeologists unexpectedly discovered the lost city of Tikal, leading to a significant restoration project overseen by Dr. Tatiana Proskouriakoff, a respected Mesoamerican archaeologist. Tourists from all corners of the globe come to Tikal to witness the magnificence of the ancient city, exploring the deteriorating ruins and envisioning the lively city that once prospered within its historic boundaries. Mayan communities visit the site as a way to honor their ancestors and the city that held their authority in the past.

{"prefix": "Homarus gammarus, known as the European lobster or common lobster, is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea. It is closely related to the American lobster, H. americanus.", "gold": "It may grow to a length of and a mass of , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws. In life the lobsters are blue, only becoming \"lobster red\" on cooking. Mating occurs in the summer, producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae. Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food, and is widely caught using lobster pots, mostly around the British Isles. Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean, with a body length up to and weighing up to , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually long and weigh . Like other crustaceans, lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow, in a process called ecdysis (molting). This may occur several times a year for young lobsters, but decreases to once every 1\u20132 years for larger animals. The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large, asymmetrical pair of feet. The larger one is the \"crusher\", and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the \"cutter\", which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. Usually, the left claw is the crusher, and the right is the cutter. The exoskeleton is generally blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment. The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap. The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics: The rostrum of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in H. gammarus.", "text1": "The European lobster is a popular seafood choice in many parts of its range, particularly in the United Kingdom, France, and Spain, where it is often served steamed or in dishes such as lobster thermidor. However, its population has been declining in recent years due to overfishing and habitat degradation, leading to concerns about its long-term sustainability.\n\nDespite these challenges, efforts are underway to conserve the species and promote more sustainable fishing practices. For example, the European Union has implemented regulations to limit the amount of lobster that can be caught each year, and some countries have established marine protected areas to provide a safe haven for lobsters and other marine life.\n\nIn addition to its commercial importance, the European lobster also plays a vital role in the marine ecosystem. As a predator, it helps to regulate the populations of other species, such as crabs and shrimp, and its burrows can provide habitat for a variety of other marine animals.\n\nDespite these benefits, the European lobster is not immune to the impacts of climate change. Rising sea temperatures and acidification are altering the chemistry of the ocean, making it harder for lobsters to build their shells and potentially reducing their populations in the future.\n\nOverall, the European lobster is a fascinating and ecologically important species that requires careful management and conservation to ensure its continued survival.

The European lobster's shell can grow up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) in length, with the largest individuals reaching weights of over 10 kilograms (22 pounds). Despite its size, the species is known for its slow growth rate, with lobsters taking up to 15 years to reach sexual maturity.\n\nEuropean lobsters have been an important part of European cuisine for centuries, with the first written records of their consumption dating back to the 16th century. They are often served steamed, grilled, or as part of seafood dishes such as bisques and chowders.

Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions, and Rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces. Square-shaped Fort Sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall, with walls made from palmetto logs high and wide. The walls were filled with sand, and rose above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted. A hastily erected palisade of thick planks helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls. An assortment of 31 cannon, ranging from 9- and 12-pounders to a few British 18-pounders and French 26-pounders, dotted the front and rear walls. General Lee, when he had seen its unfinished state, had recommended abandoning the fort, calling it a \"slaughter pen\". President Rutledge refused, and specifically ordered Colonel Moultrie to \"obey [Lee] in everything, except in leaving Fort Sullivan\". Moultrie's delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on June 27 that he would replace Moultrie; the battle began the next day before he could do so. Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to Haddrell's Point. The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31, and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day. Moultrie noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island (now known as the Isle of Palms), just a few hundred yards from Sullivan's Island; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan's. By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would \"land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns\" and that they could \"keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper\".", "text1": "As he assessed the city's defenses, he was struck by the ramshackle nature of the fortifications and the seeming lack of urgency among the local militia. \"What is the plan of defense here?\" he demanded of the local commander, a portly planter named Colonel Heyward. \"We have no plan, sir,\" replied Heyward, wiping the sweat from his brow. \"We've been expecting the Yankees to come any day now, but we haven't received any clear orders from General Beauregard.\" The commander's words echoed through the humid air, and he could feel the weight of responsibility settling upon him.

An effort is made to depict some of the film's more outlandish elements with more believability, in the style of Fleming's original novels' use of cutting-edge technology. So for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its 'cloaking' function \u2013 the glass windows and rubber tyres \u2013 are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect. Fan reaction to it was above average. After its publication Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent's adventures as a teenager, by Charlie Higson, was launched in 2005. As the novelisation was published after Benson's final original 007 novel, The Man with the Red Tattoo, it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth. 007 Legends, released in 2012, features Daniel Craig's James Bond in a Die Another Day level.

Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. The Trout Creek Mountains are semi-arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range, most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the Trout Creek Mountains. As a result, the average annual precipitation in the Trout Creek Mountains is only per year, with most areas receiving between annually. Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June. Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months. Snowpack at elevations below usually melts by April; however, at the higher elevations, snow can remain until mid-June. Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the snowpack melts. The prevailing winds are from the west-southwest, and they are normally strongest in March and April. Brief, intense thunderstorms are common between April and October. Thunderstorms in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes. Vegetation in the Trout Creek Mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses. Other common shrubs include bitterbrush, snowberry, and Ceanothus. There are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas. Common grass species include Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, cheatgrass, western needlegrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail, as well as basin wildrye in some well-drained areas.

Lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots, although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out, to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand. In 2008, 4,386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa, of which 3,462 t (79%) was caught in the British Isles (including the Channel Islands). The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of . To protect known breeding females, lobsters caught carrying eggs are to be notched on a uropod, the inner tail flap of female lobsters of reproductive size (usually above the minimum landing size 87mm carapace length). Following this, it is illegal for the female to be kept or sold, and is commonly referred to as a \"v-notch\". This notch remains for three molts of the lobster exoskeleton, providing harvest protection and continued breeding availability for 3\u20135 years. Aquaculture systems for H. gammarus are under development, and production rates are still very low. Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae, published in 1758.

Catching items and throwing them caused the action's rhythm to break. Naka stated that the rabbit was not suitable for his game engine, and he also wanted the game to be playable with only one button. Hirokazu Yasuhara came onto the team to supervise Naka and Ohshima and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping. The trio came up with the idea of him rolling into a ball. After the hedgehog character was chosen, many characters were redrawn, and the team agreed on the environments' visual complexity, with particular focus on the colors. After this, four people came onto the team to speed development up. Due to the popularity of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic to take over the American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, it was slowed down.

{"prefix": "Fueled by events such as the Waco Siege in 1993, the murders and suicides associated with the Order of the Solar Temple, and the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo incidents in Japan, German fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s, with Scientology attracting particular attention. Perceptions that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert Vaughn Young, an American ex-Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology, visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der Spiegel, a widely read weekly magazine, describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a gulag \u2013 the Rehabilitation Project Force \u2013 for members of Scientology's Sea Org found guilty of transgressions.", "gold": "From the mid-1990s onward, press articles, reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis, accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience. As noted by the religious scholar Hubert Seiwert, Scientology came to be seen as a \"serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will-less zombies, but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state\". This view of Scientology as a public enemy, Seiwert adds, \"became a matter of political correctness\": senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology, and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social ostracism. Stephen A. Kent, writing in 1998, noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed. Scientology was viewed as \"a totalitarian, business-driven organization [...] guilty of significant human rights abuses.\" Officials examining primary and secondary sources, legal documents, and the testimony of former members, concluded that the organization was \"antithetical to a democratic state\". Federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology. Government publications on the dangers of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, in large part because of public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services.", "text1": "In the aftermath of Young's article, the German government responded swiftly, citing concerns over the group's authoritarian structure and alleged human rights abuses. In January 1996, the Interior Ministry of Hesse, one of Germany's 16 states, banned the Church of Scientology, deeming it to be \"a commercial organization and not a religious organization\" and thus not eligible for constitutional protection. The move sparked a heated debate within Germany, with some calling for a nationwide ban on Scientology, while others argued that such a step would be unconstitutional and infringe on the rights of religious freedom.\n\nAs tensions escalated, the Church of Scientology retaliated, accusing the German government of perpetuating a \"witch hunt\" and targeting the group based on unfounded allegations and anti-American sentiment. The organization also launched a public relations campaign, touting its own accomplishments and human rights initiatives, while emphasizing the freedoms and autonomy enjoyed by its members.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Union, citing the principles of freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, weighed in on the controversy, urging Germany to reconsider its ban on Scientology. The Council of Europe, a human rights organization, also issued a statement expressing concern over the potential for discrimination and religious intolerance.\n\nDespite the international scrutiny, the German government remained steadfast in its position, arguing that the ban was necessary to protect the country's citizens from what it saw as the exploitative and manipulative practices of the Church of Scientology. As the debate continued to simmer, the fate of the Church of Scientology in Germany hung in the balance, with the group's future in the country uncertain and its very existence under threat.", "text2": "As the years went on, the anti-Scientology sentiment in Germany intensified. In 2007, the city of Berlin banned Scientology from its grounds, citing concerns about the group's \"totalitarian\" tendencies and potential threats to public safety. The decision was seen as a major blow to the Church, and sparked an international outcry from Scientology supporters.\n\nDespite this, the German government continued to take a hardline stance towards Scientology, viewing it as a \"sect\" rather than a religion and enforcing strict regulations on the group's activities in the country. The Church, in turn, labeled Germany as the \"most dangerous country\" for Scientology, accusing the government of persecution and discrimination.\n\nTensions came to a head in 2008, when the Church of Scientology sued the German government for millions in damages over its policies and restrictions. The case was widely watched in the media and drew in major international players, including human rights organizations and religious freedom groups.\n\nMeanwhile, internal conflicts within Scientology continued to grow, with many former members criticizing the Church's governance and practices. The Rehabilitation Project Force, once seen as a last resort for Sea Org members, had by this point become notorious for its harsh conditions and mistreatment of inmates. The Church's top echelons were accused of enriching themselves while the majority of Scientologists struggled to make ends meet.\n\nAs the Church's internal struggles intensified, the German government seemed determined to push forward with its efforts to discredit and restrict Scientology, viewing it as a threat to the country's cultural and religious landscape. The standoff between the two entities would continue for years to come, with no end in sight \u2013 a testament to the enduring power of ideology, dogma, and controversy.", "text3": "Over time, opposition towards Scientology in Germany grew stronger. In 2007, Berlin prohibited Scientology from operating within the city due to fears of its authoritarian nature and possible risks to public safety. The Church suffered a significant setback and faced backlash from its supporters worldwide. Nevertheless, the German government maintained a strict approach towards Scientology, categorizing it as a \"sect\" rather than a religion and imposing stringent rules on the organization's operations in the nation. The Church retaliated by calling Germany the most hostile nation for Scientology, alleging government mistreatment and bias. In 2008, the Church of Scientology took legal action against the German government, seeking millions in compensation for the policies and limitations imposed on them. The lawsuit attracted significant attention from the media and involved prominent global organizations focused on human rights and religious freedom. Internal disputes within Scientology escalated as numerous ex-members voiced concerns about the Church's leadership and activities. The Rehabilitation Project Force, previously considered a final option for Sea Org members, had developed a reputation for its severe treatment and poor conditions. High-ranking members of the Church were alleged to be profiting at the expense of the financial struggles faced by most Scientologists. The German government remained steadfast in its campaign to undermine and limit Scientology, perceiving it as a danger to the nation's cultural and religious fabric.

The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation. Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a \"monster\". On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas. The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions. In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident. A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The idea of \"no independence before majority rule\" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia's government was dominated by the country's white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally. Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia.", "text1": "As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the desolate landscape, the silence was shattered by the sound of screams and wails.

{"prefix": "After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature.", "gold": "The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports (Prome, Dala and Bassein), the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome. Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of Pegu revolted that same year. The king managed to send two small expeditions to Pegu but they both failed. Now, the entire eastern half of Lower Burma (Pegu and Martaban) was in open revolt. Given his precarious position, Narathihapate decided to buy time, and sue for peace with the Mongols. In November/December 1285, the king ordered his generals Ananda Pyissi and Maha Bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations. The Mongol commanders at Hanlin, who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named Zhengmian (), agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission. They repeated their 1281 demand that the Burmese king send a formal delegation to the emperor. The two sides had reached a tentative agreement by 3 March 1286, which calls for a full submission of the Pagan Empire, and central Burma to be organized as the province of Mianzhong (). After a long deliberation, the king agreed to submit but wanted the Mongol troops to withdraw. In June 1286, he sent an embassy led by Shin Ditha Pamauk, a learned monk, to the emperor's court. In January 1287, the embassy arrived at Beijing, and was received by the Yuan emperor. The Burmese delegation formally acknowledged Mongol suzerainty of their kingdom, and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country. (Indeed, the tribute was no longer nominal.) In exchange, the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops. For the emperor, the Burma campaign was the only bright spot; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly. He did not want to invest more troops pacify the rest of the kingdom. He preferred a vassal ruler. The Burmese embassy arrived back at Hlegya in May 1287, and reported the terms to the king.

Meanwhile, the British commander, General Prendergast, sent a message to the king, offering terms of surrender and promising a degree of autonomy for the Burmese kingdom. But the king, blinded by his own pride and desperation, refused to accept the offer, convinced that he could still rally his forces and drive the British out of his country.

Equally, although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels, they received no public support.

The Mongols set up military garrisons, manned mostly by Turkic-speaking Muslims from Central Asia, in 37 circuits of the former Dali Kingdom. By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward appearances of calmness, had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258\u201360 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued.

In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols. When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy.

They began to appoint local governors and military leaders from the Song dynasty, rather than imposing their own Mongol administrators. This move helped to appease the local population and gain their loyalty, which had been wavering due to the brutal Mongol methods of conquest.\n\nThe Mongols also established trade and cultural exchange programs with the borderlands, which helped to improve relations and created a sense of mutual benefit. They invited scholars and artisans from the region to come to their capital, Xanadu, to share their knowledge and skills, and in return, offered their own expertise in architecture, engineering, and governance.\n\nAs a result, the borderlands began to flourish under Mongol rule, and the region became a hub of cultural and economic activity.

Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west and at other times with China's Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself.

The Mongols then installed a puppet king, Nga Nge, in Pagan, but his reign was short-lived as the Burmese resistance movement soon gained momentum.\n\nThe Burmese were aided by the arrival of Chinese Buddhist monks, who helped to galvanize the resistance and provide military support. The famous Chinese monk, Ma Gan, is said to have played a key role in the Burmese resistance, using his knowledge of Chinese warfare to help the Burmese develop tactics to counter the Mongol army. Despite their efforts, the Mongols remained a formidable force, and it would take several more decades of conflict before the Burmese were able to drive them out of their kingdom once and for all.", "text2": "The term Taruk has undergone a fascinating semantic shift, reflecting the complex dynamics of power and identity in the region.

In his message to the legislature in 1904, Beckham again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law, which had not passed during his first term.", "gold": "The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session. Also during the session, funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor Goebel. In March 1904, Beckham signed the Day Law, mandating racial segregation of all schools in Kentucky. Berea College, a private college in eastern Kentucky that had been integrated since the 1850s, immediately filed suit to challenge the law. Its substance was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Berea appealed to the Supreme Court, which, in 1908, which decided, in Berea College v. Kentucky, against the college. Again, only Harlan dissented. Near the close of the 1904 session, legislators approved the creation of Beckham County from parts of Carter, Elliott, and Lewis Counties. Olive Hill was made the county seat. Soon, the county's existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties from which it was carved to less than . Carter County joined the lawsuit, claiming the border of Beckham County passed too close to Grayson, the seat of Carter County, and to Vanceburg, the seat of Lewis County. The state constitution forbade county borders from passing within of a county seat. On April 29, 1904, the Kentucky Court of Appeals found in favor of the plaintiffs and dissolved Beckham County. During the 1906 legislative session, Beckham urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies by following the lead of New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated for insurance companies doing business in the state to be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky to bolstering the state's economy and to provide policyholders some protection against fraud. Beckham refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably, his reasons were political. The Democrats were dominant in the region, and he wanted to avoid challenging his own party. By collecting some old US Civil War debts from the federal government, Beckham also virtually eliminated the state's debt. Encouraged by the state's improved finances, the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state's normal schools: Western State Teachers College in Bowling Green (later Western Kentucky University) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond (later part of Eastern Kentucky University).", "text1": "Despite the recent victories, Beckham faced opposition from some lawmakers who argued that a uniform textbook law would stifle creativity and diversity in education. Beckham, however, remained steadfast in his belief that a standardized curriculum was necessary to ensure a consistent and high-quality education across the state. He pointed to the chaos and inefficiencies that resulted from the current system, where teachers and administrators were forced to navigate a tangled web of competing textbook publishers and curriculum materials.\n\nIn his message, Beckham proposed a compromise: rather than mandating a single textbook for every school, he suggested that the state establish a list of approved textbooks that met certain standards for quality and accuracy. This, he argued, would allow schools to choose from a range of options while still ensuring that students received a consistent and rigorous education.\n\nThe proposal was met with a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism from lawmakers, who debated the merits of a uniform textbook law throughout the legislative session. Beckham remained engaged with the issue, meeting with educators and lawmakers to build support for his proposal. Ultimately, the legislature passed a compromise bill that established a list of approved textbooks and provided funding for schools to purchase them. The law took effect in 1906, marking a significant milestone in Beckham's efforts to modernize and standardize education in Tennessee.", "text2": "...and again proposed a bill that would establish standardized textbooks for public schools across the state. Despite facing opposition from some educators who feared it would stifle creativity and innovation in the curriculum, Beckham's persistence paid off, and the bill was eventually passed into law. The new uniform textbook law aimed to promote consistency and equity in education by providing all students with access to high-quality, state-approved materials. As a result, Tennessee made significant strides in closing the education gap and improving student outcomes.\n\nBeckham's efforts also led to the establishment of the Tennessee State Board of Education, which oversaw the implementation of the new uniform textbook law and was charged with setting academic standards for public schools throughout the state. The board was staffed by experienced educators who worked closely with local school boards to ensure that the standards and textbooks met the diverse needs of students across the state.", "text3": "...and once more suggested a bill to implement uniform textbooks in all public schools in the state. Beckham's determination led to the successful passage of the bill, despite concerns from educators about its potential impact on curriculum creativity and innovation.

Tennessee saw notable progress in narrowing the education gap and enhancing student performance.

The division assaulted and captured Bardia on 5 January and Tobruk on 22 January, with tens of thousands of Italian troops surrendering at both towns. The 6th Division took part in the pursuit of the Italian Army and captured Benghazi on 4 February. In late February it was withdrawn for service in Greece, and was replaced by the 9th Division. The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941. During April, the 6th Division, other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece. At the end of this campaign, the 6th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete. The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May, which also ended in defeat for the Allies. Over 5,000 Australians were captured in these campaigns, and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat. The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt. The 9th Division and a brigade of the 7th Division were besieged at Tobruk; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October. During June, the main body of the 7th Division, a brigade of the 6th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign against the Vichy French. Resistance was stronger than expected; Australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the French capitulated in early July. The majority of Australian units in the Mediterranean returned to Australia in early 1942, after the outbreak of the Pacific War. The 9th Division was the largest unit to remain in the Middle East, and played a key role in the First Battle of El Alamein during June and the Second Battle of El Alamein in October.

In June 1941, they took part in the Battle of Tobruk, where they helped to break the Italian siege of the besieged city. Despite being outnumbered, the Australian ships managed to sink several Italian warships and damage several others, helping to secure a crucial British victory.\n\nAs the war in North Africa continued to intensify, the Australians played a key role in supporting the British Eighth Army's advance into Libya. In November 1941, they took part in the Battle of El Daba, where they helped to sink several Italian ships and damage several others, further weakening the Italian fleet.\n\nDespite their successes, the Australians knew that their days in the Mediterranean were numbered. As the war turned against the Axis powers, the British began to shift their focus to the Pacific, where the threat from Japan was growing.

Naka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code. Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty. Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier. The team read Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they could avoid their mistakes. Sega director Fujio Minegishi had connections to the music industry, and suggested his friend Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama write the Sonic score. However, Sonic Team did not think Kayama's music would fit, and so commissioned Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True. Nakamura said he was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack, as he had just started with Dreams Come True, but accepted as he was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo.", "text1": "However, due to time constraints and the complexity of the game's coding, the sound test feature was ultimately scrapped, leaving only the two-player mode as the only multiplayer component of Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

Naka envisioned a series of mini-games and animations that would showcase the game's sound capabilities, featuring Sonic and his friends dancing and having fun to a funky soundtrack.\n\nThe animations, which were meant to be humorous and lighthearted, would have featured Sonic breakdancing to the tune of a funky beat, accompanied by his friends, including Tails, Knuckles, and even Dr. Eggman. The animations would have been rendered in a comic book style, with vibrant colors and exaggerated character designs.\n\nUnfortunately, the sound test feature was deemed too ambitious and complex to be implemented in the already-packed Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and it was ultimately cancelled.

According to Eliakim Sibanda, a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of ZAPU, Nkomo was implying that responsibility for the massacre lay with security force pseudo-guerrillas, more specifically the Selous Scouts unit, which had often been accused of brutalising rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion. Sibanda asserts that the massacre \"cannot be put beyond\" the Scouts, and also supports Nkomo's claim that the Hunyani had been used militarily, suggesting that ZIPRA might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board. \"Rhodesian television, before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique, had shown Viscounts ferrying paratroopers for the job,\" he writes, \"...

A report published in the American magazine Time a fortnight later described the incident as \"a genuine horror story, calculated to make the most alarming of Rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true.\" The white community in Rhodesia heard the news with fury, and many turned their minds to exacting retribution for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism. The prominent Indian-Rhodesian Gulab family was particularly affected by the incident, having lost eight members in the attack. Although Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash, doing so only after four days' investigation, the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours.

An underground cable was laid with assistance from British Telecom who were trialling a thrust borer which had been developed at their research facility at Martlesham Heath. The thrust borer laid of ducting through which the mains cable was pulled into position. The mill was then supplied with lights and sockets on each floor. Other work undertaken by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork, digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position. A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp. A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A Ruston & Hornsby 4YHR diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane. After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary. Off-site, the new brake wheel and fantail were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast-iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly. The fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir.

{"prefix": "It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke Hakon Magnusson, who was later to become King Hakon V of Norway. There is a circle of stones near the beach at Housa Voe, which are the remains of a 'ting', or local assembly.", "gold": "This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson, who was accused of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called \u2018dominus de Papay\u2019. (The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above.) The remains of Duke Hakon's thirteenth-century house are still visible near Housa Voe. In 1469 Shetland came under nominal Scottish control, although the Norse 'Lairds of Norway' kept their Papa Stour estates until the 17th century. In the 16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet. By the 18th century, two Scottish lairds, Thomas Gifford of Busta, and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick, owned the island. They maintained a prosperous Haaf (Old Norse: 'deep sea') fishing industry, undertaken in the summer months using six-oared boats known as sixareens. In addition to the leper colony on Brei Holm there may have been another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Hamna Voe. A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony. The island church, which overlooks Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore Wick, was founded in 1806. 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of Sneeans or Sn\u00f8yans on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of Tusselby. It is called the 'ald kirk' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as \"the site of a Romish chapel belonging to about the twelfth century\". There is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day's work on the building was destroyed during the night. Eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re-commenced there successfully. Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib, suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it. In the 19th century the Crabbaberry fishing station in West Voe was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more.", "text1": "The year was 1219, and the air was thick with tension as Duke Hakon Magnusson's household stirred with the sound of rustling wool and clanging steel.

But as the day wore on, the atmosphere grew increasingly uneasy. The visitors from the mainland, brought by Duke Hakon to discuss a proposed marriage alliance between his daughter and the son of the Danish king, began to whisper among themselves, their voices laced with distrust.\n\nSuddenly, a commotion erupted outside, and the sound of shouting and crashing filled the air.

In 2009, the video was included on Madonna's compilation, Celebration: The Video Collection. \"Sorry\" was performed on the 2006 Confessions Tour as part of the bedouin themed segment. Madonna was dressed in a Jean-Paul Gaultier kaftan with pants and high heeled boots. As Madonna finished the performance of the song \"Isaac\", she took off the kaftan and wore a jacket given to her by the dancers and greets them one by one. The song was also used as a video backdrop during the interlude between the bedouin and the glam/rock sections.

Morris and others openly supported the Miskito Indian group Misurasata, who were allied with the anti-revolutionary, CIA-backed Contras. Journalists such as Harlan McKosato attributed the split to Means and other AIM members dividing over opposition to the Bellecourt brothers because of their alleged involvement in the execution of Anna Mae Aquash in December 1975, who was then the highest-ranking woman in AIM but had been suspected of being an informant. It was a year in which other FBI informants had been discovered in AIM. On November 3, 1999, Means held a press conference in Denver, Colorado in which he accused the Bellecourt brothers of complicity in Aquash's death, and named three lower-level AIM members involved in her death: Arlo Looking Cloud, John Graham, and Theda Nelson Clarke. This was the first time that an AIM leader active at the time of the Aquash murder had publicly accused AIM of having been involved. Looking Cloud and Graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010, by federal and South Dakota state juries, respectively. By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted.

The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast-iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly. The fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft.

{"prefix": "\"Back Off Boogaloo\" is a song by English rock musician Ringo Starr that was released as a non-album single in March 1972. Starr's former Beatles bandmate George Harrison produced the recording and helped Starr write the song, although he remained uncredited as a co-writer until 2017.", "gold": "Recording took place in London shortly after the pair had appeared together at Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh shows in August 1971. The single was a follow-up to Starr's 1971 hit song \"It Don't Come Easy\" and continued his successful run as a solo artist. \"Back Off Boogaloo\" peaked at number 2 in Britain and Canada, and number 9 on America's Billboard Hot 100. It remains Starr's highest-charting single in the United Kingdom. The title for the song was inspired by English singer-songwriter Marc Bolan. Several commentators have interpreted the lyrics as an attack on Paul McCartney, reflecting Starr's disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years. \"Back Off Boogaloo\" demonstrates the influence of glam rock on Starr, who directed the documentary film Born to Boogie about Bolan's band T. Rex around this time. Described by one biographer as a \"high-energy in-your-face rocker\", the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus Voormann. Starr made a promotional film for the single in which he is followed around the grounds of John Lennon's Tittenhurst Park property by a Frankenstein-like monster. The single's B-side, \"Blindman\", was originally intended as the theme song to the 1971 film of the same name, a spaghetti western in which Starr had a starring role. Starr re-recorded \"Back Off Boogaloo\" for both his 1981 album Stop and Smell the Roses and his 2017 album Give More Love. A collaboration with American singer Harry Nilsson, the 1981 version incorporates lyrics from Beatles songs such as \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", \"Good Day Sunshine\" and \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\". The original recording has appeared on Starr's compilation albums Blast from Your Past and Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr, and as a bonus track on his remastered 1974 studio album Goodnight Vienna.", "text1": "The song's catchy chorus and memorable melody made it an instant hit, reaching the top 9 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and earning a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The single's success can be attributed in part to its innovative music video, which featured Starr performing the song with a cast of colorful characters, including a dancing woman in a red wig and a group of hippies playing instruments in a psychedelic-filled room. The video was a departure from the traditional live-performance style of music videos at the time and helped to further establish Starr as a solo artist.", "text2": "The song \"Back Off Boogaloo\" was a funky, upbeat track that combined Starr's signature drumming style with a catchy melody and lyrics that spoke to the era's growing sense of disillusionment and social unrest. The recording features a memorable guitar riff by Harrison, who was heavily influenced by his own experiences as a peace activist during the Beatles' tumultuous breakup.\n\nStarr himself has said that the song was born out of frustration and rebellion, inspired by the cultural shifts taking place at the time. \"Back Off Boogaloo\" has been interpreted as both a call to resistance against societal pressure and a defiant anthem to individuality.\n\nUpon its release, the song was met with mixed reception, with some fans and critics dismissing it as lightweight and inconsequential compared to the groundbreaking work of Starr's Beatle contemporaries. However, over the years, \"Back Off Boogaloo\" has become a cult classic, earning a reputation as one of Starr's most energetic and infectious songs.\n\nToday, the song remains a staple of Starr's live shows and has been praised by fans and artists alike for its catchy hooks, driving rhythm, and timeless themes of nonconformity and rebellion. Despite its humble beginnings as a solo single, \"Back Off Boogaloo\" has become a testament to the enduring power of music to capture the essence of a particular moment in time.", "text3": "\"Back Off Boogaloo\" was a lively song that mixed Starr's unique drumming with a memorable melody and lyrics reflecting the disillusionment and social unrest of the time.

During his second term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a US senator. His stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party, and in 1908 the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican William O. Bradley, who had been governor from 1895 to 1899. Six years later, Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election bid in 1920, largely because of his pro-temperance views and his opposition to women's suffrage. Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing both in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 (with suspected electoral fraud) and his senatorial campaign in 1936. He died in Louisville on January 9, 1940. Beckham County, Oklahoma, is named for him. He was born at Wickland, near Bardstown in Nelson County, Kentucky, son of William Netherton and Julia Tevis (Wickliffe) Beckham. His maternal grandfather, Charles A. Wickliffe, was governor of Kentucky from 1839 to 1840 and served as postmaster general in the administration of John Tyler. His uncle, Robert C. Wickliffe, served as governor of Louisiana. Beckham obtained his early education at Roseland Academy in Bardstown. In 1881, he served as a page in the Kentucky House of Representatives at 12. Later, he enrolled at Central University (now Eastern Kentucky University) in Richmond, Kentucky but was forced to quit school at 17 to support his widowed mother. Two years later, he became principal of Bardstown public schools, from 1888 to 1893. Concurrently, he studied law at the University of Kentucky, where he earned his law degree in 1889. He was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Bardstown in 1893. He also served as president of the Young Democrats' Club of Nelson County. Beckham's political career began in 1894, when he was elected without opposition to the Kentucky House of Representatives. He served four consecutive terms and was its Speaker in 1898, his final year in the House. He also served as a delegate to every Democratic National Convention from 1900 to 1920.

Taylor, meanwhile, had fled to a small town in the Midwest, where he began to secretly rebuild his political network and gather support for a potential comeback.\n\nAs tensions between Beckham's administration and Taylor's loyalists continued to escalate, a shocking revelation emerged: it was discovered that Beckham's campaign had received significant funding from a mysterious donor, rumored to be a wealthy businessman with ties to the Democratic Party.

He attempted a comeback in 1988 before NASCAR banned him for testing positive for excessive over-the-counter drugs, ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine; NASCAR later announced they gave Richmond a new test and tested negative.

Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency. For decades in his writings, Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose. He says, Set the blood quantum at one-quarter, hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians, let intermarriage proceed as it [has] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence. Churchill's assertions have been raised as one of the several research-misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 (see below). He has been accused of using his interpretation of the Dawes Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member. Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture, and what he describes as the genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the Americas by European-American settlers and the ongoing repression of native peoples.

In 1986, Churchill wrote an essay titled Pacifism as Pathology: Notes on an American Pseudopraxis criticizing pacifist politics within the U.S. left as being hypocritical, de facto racist and ineffectual. In 1998, Arbeiter Ring Publishing published the essay in a book entitled Pacifism as Pathology: Reflections on the Role of Armed Struggle in North America and listing Ward Churchill as the author.

Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with the fact that most of the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds.

The song talks about personal empowerment and self-sufficiency, denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like \"Everybody\" (1982), \"Vogue\" (1990) or \"Music\" (2000) which was centered around the subject of music itself.", "gold": "Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix consisted of additional vocals provided by Neil Tennant from the group. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \"Heart\" (1988) for Madonna but never delivered it. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \"Sorry\" is the \"album's strongest track\" and that it is a \"Pet Shop Boys-esque\" song. Vineyard went on to say that it \"...wistfully evokes the sounds of the '80s-era dance clubs that first lofted her toward stardom.\" According to a review in the BBC's Collective, \"New single 'Sorry' states Queen Madge's unapologetic stance, and though the song is wrapped up in relationship sentiment, one cannot help but hear the subtext, perhaps directed at her more savage critics: 'there are more important things than hearing you speak'.\" Alan Braidwood from BBC Music called the song \"lethally catchy\". Mike Pattenden of The Times and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that the bassline of the song utilizes The Jacksons' 1980 song \"Can You Feel It\". The song was noted by Slant Magazine as one of the best songs of 2006. In a review of \"Sorry\" from Virgin Media, it wrote that the song's musicscape features an \"infectious combo of pumping, filtered synths and disco beats\". Keith Caulfield from Billboard commented that, \"[Sorry] should keep fans hung up on Madonna's ability to create instant radio and club classics.\" He also called the song \"springy\" while reviewing the album. Ben Williams of New York magazine, wrote that the song is \"propelled by a catchy bass melody\". Joan Morgan of The Village Voice, in review of Confessions on a Dance Floor, wrote: \"The party continues admirably with the multilingual, kick-your-man-to-the-curb 'Sorry'.\" Stephen M.

Madonna's vocals are energetic and emotive, conveying a sense of passion and urgency. The song's arrangement also includes a haunting instrumental section, featuring a traditional Japanese shamisen and a Polish folk melody, adding to the song's global and eclectic sound.\n\nAs the song builds towards its climax, Madonna's lyrics become more introspective, speaking directly to the listener about the importance of finding one's own voice and staying true to oneself.

Route 50 intersects several roads, including Route 49 in Tuckahoe, US 40 in Mays Landing, and US 322 and the Atlantic City Expressway in Hamilton Township. The portion of current Route 50 between Seaville and Petersburg received funding in 1910 to become a spur of the Ocean Highway. In 1917, what is now Route 50 was designated a part of pre-1927 Route 14, a route that was to run from Cape May to Egg Harbor City. Route 50 was designated onto its current alignment in 1927, replacing this portion of pre-1927 Route 14. In 1960, a freeway was proposed for Route 50, running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township to US 30 in Mullica Township. This proposal was canceled by the mid-1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic. The interchange between Route 50 and the Atlantic City Expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange, with completion in June 2010. Route 50 begins at an intersection with US 9 in the Seaville section of Upper Township, Cape May County, heading to the north on a two-lane undivided road.

Although Nintendo eventually overtook Sega, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo did not lead the console market. Sonic the Hedgehog inspired similar platformers starring animal mascots, including Bubsy, Aero the Acro-Bat, James Pond 3, Earthworm Jim, Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, and Radical Rex. \"Animal with attitude\" games carried over to the next generation of consoles, with the developers of Crash Bandicoot and Gex citing Sonic as a major inspiration. Sonic's success led to an extensive media franchise, with the first of many sequels, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, released the following year. It has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters, keeping Sonic and Robotnik (later renamed as Eggman) mainstays, and continued beyond Sega's exit from the console industry after the Dreamcast. The series has ventured from platformers to fighting, racing, role-playing, and sports games, and also expanded into anime, manga, cartoons comic books, novels, and toys.

{"prefix": "While elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy proposed this in early 1942, it was judged to be impossible by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia. This fact was not known by the Allies at the time, and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion.", "gold": "Large numbers of United States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early 1942, and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur in March. Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943. After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay. Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the Kokoda Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and USAAF. Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard-fought Battle of Buna-Gona. The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of Wau in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the Salamaua-Lae campaign in April. In late 1943, the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation Cartwheel, when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the Huon Peninsula during the Huon Peninsula campaign and Finisterre Range campaign. The Australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943. Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943. These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea, but were unsuccessful. On 14 May 1943 the hospital ship AHS Centaur was sunk by a Japanese submarine off Brisbane with the loss of 268 lives. Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI). Australia's role in the Pacific War declined from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there.", "text1": "As a result of the mistaken assumption, Australian forces were spread thin across the continent, with troops stationed in remote areas to defend against a potential invasion. Meanwhile, the Japanese continued to gain ground in the Pacific, capturing key islands and territories with relative ease. The Australians, confident in their ability to repel an invasion, focused their efforts on defending against a Japanese attack, rather than pursuing a more proactive strategy.\n\nIn the midst of this confusion, the Japanese launched a series of surprise attacks against Australian shipping and coastal towns, further eroding the nation's confidence and sense of security. The city of Darwin, in particular, was targeted, with multiple bombing raids causing widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\nAs the situation continued to deteriorate, Australian Prime Minister John Curtin grew increasingly concerned about the country's ability to defend itself. In a desperate bid to bolster the nation's defenses, he turned to the United States for assistance, requesting that American troops be deployed to Australia to help fend off the Japanese threat.\n\nDespite the initial hesitation from Washington, the US eventually agreed to send troops to Australia, with the first American soldiers arriving in July 1942.

At the same time, the United States directed its military efforts towards defeating Japan in the Asia-Pacific region while still dealing with the aftermath of Pearl Harbor. The US Pacific Fleet, with increased resources, fought against the Japanese navy in key battles like the Coral Sea and Midway. In Australia, the military was on high alert, with soldiers positioned strategically along the coast and anti-aircraft guns set up to defend major cities from possible air attacks.

One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan. The Burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated.

Australian forces began arriving on the island between November and December 1944, initially establishing themselves around the US base at Torokina. Due to inaccurate intelligence, Savige mistakenly believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17,500 men, and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere, rather than maintaining the defensive posture the US forces had adopted. However, Allied estimates of Japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of Japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40,000. The campaign that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east\u2013west avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further counter-attacks, while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast; and the main campaign in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around Buin. Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in December 1944, the Australian 7th Brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards Buin. In late March and early April 1945, they had fought the Battle of Slater's Knoll after which a brief lull followed as the Australians paused to shorten their supply lines. Meanwhile, the survivors of the Japanese force, heavily demoralised by their defeat, withdrew towards the Hongorai River. The Australian 3rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south, being tasked with capturing the Hari River, while the Hongorai was also included as an \"intermediate objective\". Japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the Australians at about 10,500 men, of which 2,300 were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd Division. The 15th Brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the Australian units on Bougainville at the time and was moved up to relieve the 7th Brigade, which was in need of rest.", "text1": "As the months dragged on, the US forces continued to reinforce their positions around Torokina, slowly building up their strength and supplies. Meanwhile, the Japanese forces on Bougainville remained largely bottled up, with little opportunity to launch another major counter-attack. Despite this, the Japanese continued to harass the US forces with periodic raids and ambushes, but these were easily repelled by the well-entrenched US troops.\n\nIn the autumn of 1944, a small team of Australian commandos was sent to Bougainville to conduct a series of reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines. Led by Major Jimmy Wilson, the team of eight men moved undetected through the jungle, gathering valuable intelligence on Japanese troop movements and positions. Their reports helped the US forces to refine their defensive strategy, and eventually led to the capture of several key Japanese supply dumps.\n\nAs the winter of 1944 drew to a close, the US forces on Bougainville were feeling increasingly confident. They had repelled the Japanese counter-attack, and had established a solid foothold on the island. With the Allies poised to launch a major push to recapture the Philippines, the US forces on Bougainville were now focused on preparing for a potential push northwards, towards the Japanese stronghold on the island of Rabaul. Little did they know, however, that the Japanese were already planning a desperate bid to retake the initiative on Bougainville, one that would prove to be a bloody and brutal struggle.", "text2": "As the months dragged on, the stalemate on Bougainville only intensified.

The US and Australian troops, meanwhile, were hampered by the same issues, struggling to dislodge the Japanese without sacrificing too many men.\n\nDespite the lack of significant gains, the US command continued to pour resources into the campaign, recognizing the strategic importance of Bougainville as a stepping stone to the eventual invasion of the Philippine Islands. The US military also remained committed to the principle of securing the island as quickly as possible, even if it meant absorbing heavier casualties.

{"prefix": "Clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of Georgia, James Wright, who had been arrested, and then escaped to a navy ship. Parker's fleet had an extremely difficult crossing.", "gold": "Battered by storms and high seas, the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at Cape Fear until April 18, and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3. After several weeks there, in which the British troops raided Patriot properties, Clinton, Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations. Parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions up and down the coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there. John Rutledge, recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina's revolutionary government, organized a defense force under the command of 46-year-old Colonel William Moultrie, a former militiaman and Indian fighter. These forces comprised three infantry regiments, two rifle regiments, and a small artillery regiment; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies, and the total force numbered about 2,000. These forces were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and Virginia (1,900 troops), as well as militia numbering 2,700 from Charleston and the surrounding backcountry. Moultrie saw Sullivan's Island, a sandy spit of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about long and a few hundred yards wide, as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from intruding enemy warships. A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar, a series of submerged shoals lying about southeast of the city, and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan's Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor. Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island, where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city. Moultrie and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan's Island in March 1776, and began construction of a fortress built out of palmetto logs to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor. The construction moved slowly; Captain Peter Horry of the Patriot naval detachment described the site as \"an immense pen 500 feet long, and 16 feet wide, filled with sand to stop the shot\".

His crew, already exhausted and demoralized, clung to the rigging for dear life.\n\nAs the storm raged on, Clinton spotted a figure clinging to the side of the ship - James Wright, the royal governor of Georgia, his eyes wild with fear and his face pale with exhaustion. Clinton rushed to his side, helping him aboard and wrapping him in a warm blanket. The governor's gratitude was palpable as Clinton promised to do everything in his power to ensure his safe return to the colony.\n\nAs the storm finally began to subside, Clinton called a meeting with his officers to discuss their next move. They were now running low on supplies, and the crossing was far from over. Clinton knew that every decision they made would have a direct impact on their chances of success. He weighed the risks and benefits of pushing on, but his instincts told him that they couldn't afford to linger.

{"prefix": "The development of an enantioselective Nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repertoire of Nazarov cyclization reactions. To that end, several variations have been developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts.", "gold": "Diastereoselective cyclizations are also known, in which extant stereocenters direct the cyclization. Almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of torquoselectivity; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to \"rotate\" in turn sets the stereochemistry as shown below. Silicon-directed Nazarov cyclizations can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way. In the example below, the silyl-group acts to direct the cyclization by preventing the distant alkene from rotating \"towards\" it via unfavorable steric interaction. In this way the silicon acts as a traceless auxiliary. (The starting material is not enantiopure but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the cyclization.) Tius's allenyl substrates can exhibit axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used. The example below generates a chiral diosphenpol in 64% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess. Tius has additionally developed a camphor-based auxiliary for achiral allenes that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of roseophilin. The key step employs an unusual mixture of hexafluoro-2-propanol and trifluoroethanol as solvent. The first chiral Lewis acid promoted asymmetric Nazarov cyclization was reported by Varinder Aggarwal and utilized copper (II) bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98% ee. The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50 mol% of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased. Extensions of the Nazarov cyclization are generally also subsumed under the same name. For example, an \u03b1-\u03b2, \u03b3-\u03b4 unsaturated ketone can undergo a similar cationic conrotatory cyclization that is typically referred to as an iso-Nazarov cyclization reaction.", "text1": "Here is a possible continuation:\n\nIn recent years, the use of chiral auxiliaries has proven to be a successful strategy in achieving enantioselectivity in Nazarov cyclizations. For example, the incorporation of chiral aldehydes or ketones into the Nazarov cyclization precursor has been shown to induce enantioselectivity through steric and stereoelectronic effects. This approach has been utilized in the synthesis of various chiral compounds, including terpenes and natural products.\n\nIn addition to chiral auxiliaries, the use of chiral catalysts has also been explored in Nazarov cyclizations. Transition metal complexes, such as palladium and rhodium, have been found to promote enantioselective Nazarov cyclizations when coordinated to chiral ligands. These ligands can be designed to possess stereocenters that interact with the substrate, thereby influencing the outcome of the reaction.\n\nMore recently, the development of chiral ionic liquids has opened up new possibilities for enantioselective Nazarov cyclizations. These ionic liquids can be designed to incorporate chiral moieties that interact with the substrate, leading to enhanced enantioselectivity. This approach has been shown to be particularly effective in the synthesis of chiral lactones and other carbocyclic compounds.\n\nDespite the progress that has been made in developing enantioselective Nazarov cyclizations, there is still much to be explored in this area. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanistic aspects of these reactions and to develop more efficient and practical methods for their implementation.", "text2": "Notably, the use of chiral auxiliaries has been shown to be a successful strategy for inducing enantioinduction in the Nazarov cyclization.

Additionally, the use of chiral pyrazolidinones and chiral azetidinones have also been reported as effective chiral auxiliaries for this transformation.\n\nOn the other hand, the use of chiral catalysts, such as chiral palladium and chiral ruthenium complexes, has also been developed as an effective approach for inducing enantioinduction in the Nazarov cyclization. For example, the use of chiral P,N-ligand palladium complexes has been shown to lead to high enantioselectivities (up to >95%) in the presence of certain solvents and reaction conditions. Similarly, the use of chiral RuCl2(PCy3)x complexes has been reported as effective for inducing enantioinduction in the Nazarov cyclization reaction.\n\nThe success of enantioselective Nazarov cyclization reactions is not limited to the use of chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts, but also depends on the careful tuning of reaction conditions such as the choice of solvent, temperature, and reaction time. For instance, the use of certain solvents like ionic liquids and fluorous media has been reported to enhance enantioinduction, while the use of high pressures and microwave irradiation has been shown to improve reaction yields.\n\nOverall, the development of enantioselective Nazarov cyclization reactions is an active area of research, with continued advancements in the use of chiral auxiliaries, chiral catalysts, and reaction conditions enabling the creation of chiral molecules with high enantiopurities, a key goal of organic synthesis.", "text3": "The use of chiral auxiliaries has proven to be an effective method for causing enantioinduction in the Nazarov cyclization.

{"prefix": "However, modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research. In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity.", "gold": "These have been successful to varying degrees. Additionally, modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction, either by generating the pentadienyl cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the oxyallyl cation \"intercepted\" in various ways. Furthermore, enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed. The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field; key examples are given below. The earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the Nazarov cyclization took advantage of the \u03b2-silicon effect in order to direct the regioselectivity of the elimination step. This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in the mid-1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron trichloride to promote the reaction. With bicyclic products, the cis isomer was selected for to varying degrees. The silicon-directed Nazarov cyclization reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product Silphinene, shown below. The cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety, so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether. Drawing on the substituent effects compiled over various trials of the reaction, Professor Alison Frontier of the University of Rochester developed a paradigm for \"polarized\" Nazarov cyclizations in which electron donating and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction. Creation of an effective vinyl nucleophile and vinyl electrophile in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper triflate and regioselective elimination. In addition, the electron withdrawing group increases the acidity of the \u03b1-proton, allowing selective formation of the trans-\u03b1-epimer via equilibration. It is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a donating or withdrawing group alone, although the efficiency of the reaction (yield, reaction time, etc.) is typically lower. By extension, any pentadienyl cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a Nazarov cyclization.", "text1": "Recent studies have made significant progress in addressing these challenges. For instance, the development of novel organocatalysts has enabled the promotion of the reaction with high efficiency and selectivity, rendering the process catalytic and eliminating the need for stoichiometric amounts of promoters (1).

Moreover, the development of chiral auxiliaries and stereoselective catalysts has improved the overall stereoselectivity of the reaction, allowing for the efficient synthesis of enantiomerically pure compounds (4).\n\nThe successful integration of these advances has led to the development of more efficient and practical methodologies for the synthesis of various classes of compounds, including heterocycles, natural products, and pharmaceuticals.

As part of Australia's continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia, army, naval and airforce units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only. On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help mop up infiltrators from seaborne and airborne incursions at Labis and Pontian, in September and October 1964. Following these raids the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo. During the early phases, British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the Malaysian/Indonesian border, and to protect population centres.

By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would \"land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns\" and that they could \"keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper\". The British fleet was composed of nine man-of-war ships: the flagship 50-gun Bristol, as well as the 50-gun Experiment and frigates Actaeon, Active, Solebay, , Sphinx, and the bomb vessel Thunder, in total mounting nearly 300 cannon.

On June 7, Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms. However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it (which was flying a truce flag), and it was not delivered until the next day. That same day, Clinton began landing 2,200 troops on Long Island. The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan.

But as the day wore on, it became clear that the fort was not going to fall without a fight. The defenders were stubborn and well-entrenched, and the British were beginning to suffer significant casualties.\n\nJust as Lee was starting to realize that the battle was not going to be as easy as he had hoped, a message arrived from Admiral Arbuthnot, who was in charge of the overall British naval operation. The message was brief and to the point: \"Pray, General Lee, do not risk further loss of life or ships. We will take the fort when we are ready.\"\n\nLee's face turned red with rage as he read the message. He was being told to back off, to abandon the battle and retreat.

Moultrie's tactics caused confusion and disorganization among the British troops, leading to difficulties in coordinating their attack. The American forces recognized the chance to strike back as the British struggled to coordinate their attack. Moultrie instructed his soldiers to stand firm while also devising a covert strategy for potential retreat in case the fort's defenses were breached. Lee was getting more and more annoyed with his soldiers' slow advancement, so he kept sending messages to Moultrie urging him to take decisive action against the defenders.

{"prefix": "The planet takes 4.617 days to complete an orbit, with a semimajor axis of 0.0595 AU. A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found.", "gold": "The true mass may be much greater depending on the inclination of the orbit. A mass of and an inclination of 24\u00b0 were later found using high-resolution spectroscopy. Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface. The Spitzer Space Telescope measured the planet temperature, and found that the difference between the two sides of Upsilon Andromedae b of about 1,400 degrees Celsius, ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1,400 to 1,650 degrees Celsius. The temperature difference has led to speculation that Upsilon Andromedae b is tidal locked with the same side always facing Upsilon Andromedae A. Sudarsky had, on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium, predicted Upsilon Andromedae b to have reflective clouds of silicates and iron in its upper atmosphere. The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun's radiation; between that and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. The outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides, but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The chemical elements in the atmosphere can be studied by finding their absorption lines in the thermal spectrum of the planet; given typical planet temperatures, the spectrum has its peak at infrared wavelengths. So far, only water vapor has been detected in this planet, while carbon monoxide and methane are still under the detection limit. The planet is unlikely to have large moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system. The planet (with 51 Pegasi b) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by Planetpol. Preliminary results from polarimetric studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color, is 1.36 times as large and 0.74 times as massive as Jupiter, meaning that the mean density is 0.36g/cm3. It has a geometric albedo of 0.35 in visible light. Tidal heating models predict a similar mass for the planet. Upsilon Andromedae b appears to be responsible for increased chromospheric activity on its parent star.", "text1": "As a result, subsequent studies have employed alternative methods, such as astrometry and transit photometry, to refine the mass estimate of Upsilon Andromedae b. The most recent measurements suggest that the exoplanet has a mass of approximately 11.8 times that of Jupiter, making it a significant departure from the previously calculated lower limit.\n\nDespite its massive size, Upsilon Andromedae b orbits its star at a relatively close distance, with an average distance of about 0.0595 AU. This proximity leads to a surface temperature of around 1800 K, making it one of the hottest known exoplanets.\n\nFurther analysis of the planet's properties has revealed a density of approximately 1.3 times that of Jupiter, indicating a possible presence of heavy elements in its composition. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of planetary formation and evolution, as they suggest that massive planets can form in a wide range of environments, even in close proximity to their stars.", "text2": "This lower limit is estimated to be around 11.7 Jupiter masses, meaning that the actual mass of Upsilon Andromedae b could potentially be higher. Despite this, the discovery of the planet was a groundbreaking moment for exoplanetary research, providing insight into the formation and evolution of planetary systems around stars similar to the Sun. Further studies using alternative detection methods, such as transit observations or direct imaging, may be necessary to determine a more accurate mass estimate for this massive exoplanet.", "text3": "The estimated lower limit is approximately 11.7 Jupiter masses, suggesting that Upsilon Andromedae b may have a higher actual mass.

Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself.", "gold": "Between the newly conquered Mongol territory and Pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan as well as the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges. The Mongol Empire first arrived at the doorstep of the Pagan Empire in 1252 by invading the Dali Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China. The Mongol armies captured the capital, Dali, on 7 January 1253, and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by 1257. The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song. For the next dozen years, they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land, which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India. The Mongols set up military garrisons, manned mostly by Turkic-speaking Muslims from Central Asia, in 37 circuits of the former Dali Kingdom. By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward appearances of calmness, had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258\u201360 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy. The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early 1270s.

Six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross. The Boxer Rebellion in China began in 1900, and a number of western nations\u2014including many European powers, the United States, and Japan\u2014soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests. In June, the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China. The colonies also offered to assist further, but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa, they had to rely on naval forces for manpower. The force dispatched was a modest one, with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria, 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector, under the command of Captain William Creswell. Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade reservists, who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role. Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks, Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War. The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors, while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks. The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the NSW Marine Light Infantry. The contingents from New South Wales and Victoria sailed for China on 8 August 1900. Arriving in Tientsin, the Australians provided 300 men to an 8,000-strong multinational force tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at Pei Tang, which dominated a key railway. They arrived too late to take part in the battle, but were involved in the attack on the fortress at Pao-ting Fu, where the Chinese government was believed to have found asylum after Peking was captured by western forces. The Victorians joined a force of 7,500 men on a ten-day march to the fort, once again only to find that it had already surrendered. The Victorians then garrisoned Tientsin and the New South Wales contingent undertook garrison duties in Peking. HMCS Protector was mostly used for survey, transport, and courier duties in the Gulf of Chihli, before departing in November.", "text1": "As the news of the final defeat of the Boers spread, the 5th Queensland Imperial Bushmen received a hero's welcome back in Brisbane.

Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!\" Despite the generally positive reviews the film received when released, a retrospective comment piece in 2020 stated that it is \u201cconsidered by many to be the worst entry in James Bond\u2019s canon\u201d and compares unfavourably to The Bourne Identity (released several months previously), which \u201cushered in a new era of violent, gritty action-espionage movies\u201d and gave rise to the \u201cstripped-down, no-nonsense\u201d Bond of Daniel Craig. However, the amount of product placement in Die Another Day had been a contemporaneous point of criticism, with the BBC, Time and Reuters referring mockingly to the film using the title \u201cBuy Another Day\u201d. The producers subsequently chose to limit the number of companies involved in product placement to eight for the next Bond film, Casino Royale, in 2006. Die Another Day was novelised by the then-official James Bond writer, Raymond Benson, based on the screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. An effort is made to depict some of the film's more outlandish elements with more believability, in the style of Fleming's original novels' use of cutting-edge technology. So for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its 'cloaking' function \u2013 the glass windows and rubber tyres \u2013 are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect. Fan reaction to it was above average. After its publication Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent's adventures as a teenager, by Charlie Higson, was launched in 2005. As the novelisation was published after Benson's final original 007 novel, The Man with the Red Tattoo, it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth.", "text1": "\"...and it's a wonder that the film's director, Lee Tamahori, was able to convince anyone to greenlight such a travesty. The plot, which involves a North Korean terrorist organization stealing a boatload of rare earth minerals and a nuclear bomb, is a jumbled mess of absurdity and cliches. Pierce Brosnan's Bond is more bumbling than suave, and Halle Berry's Jinx is a predictable, one-dimensional love interest. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, with gems like 'I'm not a cold-hearted killer, I'm just a highly skilled assassin' delivered with all the conviction of a sleepy sloth.\n\nThe whole thing reeks of desperation, as if the producers were trying to cash in on the franchise's popularity without putting in any actual effort. And don't even get me started on Madonna's atrocious theme song, 'Die Another Day', which is an affront to the senses and an insult to the very concept of music. Overall, Die Another Day is a mess from start to finish, and a sad, sad excuse for a Bond film.", "text2": "\"But the film's true travesty is not the visual effects, but the way in which it undermines the credibility and intelligence of the James Bond character.

The villain, Gustav Graves, is a one-dimensional caricature, with motivations as flimsy as his facial hair and a plan as absurd as his obsession with North Korea's nuclear ambitions.\n\n\"Furthermore, the film's attempts at humor are as forced as they are grating, with Halle Berry's Jinx descending from a sultry and sophisticated femme fatale to a bumbling and awkward accomplice. Pierce Brosnan's Bond is as charming as ever, but he can't overcome the drivel that surrounds him.\n\n\"In the end, 'Die Another Day' is a misfire on nearly every level, a shame considering the rich heritage of the James Bond franchise.

Bond is portrayed as a caricature, using outlandish gadgets and unlikely events to save the day instead of his usual intelligence and combat abilities. The film's storyline is a chaotic mix of different genres, shifting abruptly from spy thriller to comedic campiness to unbelievable science fiction. Gustav Graves, the villain, is portrayed as a shallow character with weak motivations and a ridiculous plan. Additionally, the film's humor feels unnatural and irritating, as Halle Berry's character Jinx goes from being a seductive and elegant femme fatale to a clumsy and uncomfortable sidekick. Despite Pierce Brosnan's charm, he is unable to rise above the nonsensical elements surrounding his character.

By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would \"land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns\" and that they could \"keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper\". The British fleet was composed of nine man-of-war ships: the flagship 50-gun Bristol, as well as the 50-gun Experiment and frigates Actaeon, Active, Solebay, , Sphinx, and the bomb vessel Thunder, in total mounting nearly 300 cannon. The army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th, 28th, 33rd, 37th, 54th, and 57th Regiments of Foot, and part of the 46th. On June 7, Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms. However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it (which was flying a truce flag), and it was not delivered until the next day. That same day, Clinton began landing 2,200 troops on Long Island. The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6 km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role.", "text1": "As the British fleet approached Charleston Harbor, Lee anxiously scanned the horizon, his eyes fixed on the defenses of the city.

He gave the order to raise the batteries of Fort Moultrie, and the guns began to roar, sending shot and shell hurtling towards the British fleet.

He is a champion of the 103rd Grey Cup. Prior to being drafted by the Edmonton Eskimos in the fourth round of the 2007 CFL Draft, McCarty played high school football for the St. Thomas More Knights, where he broke multiple school records. He later played college football for the Western Washington Vikings. With the Vikings, McCarty developed into a dual threat, being used heavily as a rusher and receiver. McCarty has spent his entire professional career with the Edmonton Eskimos, making him the most veteran player on the team as of the 2015 season. McCarty played high school football for the St. Thomas More Knights in Burnaby, British Columbia beginning in 1998, playing as both a running back and middle linebacker on the Grade 8 team. He quickly became a key player on the team, including rushing for 185 yards and four touchdowns while adding 10 defensive tackles in the Grade 8 provincial semi-finals on November 24 against the Handsworth Royals. For that performance, he was named \"Star of the Week\" by The Vancouver Sun. The Knights went on to defeat the Vancouver College Fighting Irish 48\u20130 in the Grade 8 B.C. championship game, where McCarty scored another three touchdowns. The following year, McCarty joined the senior team at St. Thomas More, skipping the junior team entirely. He continued in his role as a running back while switching to the secondary defensively. Despite being a rare Grade 9 player on the senior team, he was one of the Knights' two leading rushers that year. McCarty scored a touchdown in the AAA B.C. championship game, helping the Knights win their first senior title as they beat the Pinetree T-Wolves 29\u20136. While K.C. Steele, the Knights' coach, has a policy of not recording player statistics, it is estimated that McCarty finished 1999 with over 1,000 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns.

He was also a respected leader, serving as a mentor to younger players and offering guidance and support whenever needed.\n\nDespite his success on the field, McCarty's greatest achievement may have been his impact off the field. He was a dedicated member of the Eskimos' community outreach program, participating in numerous charitable events and appearances throughout his career. He was particularly passionate about working with local youth, using his platform to promote the importance of education, healthy living, and teamwork.\n\nAfter retiring from professional football in 2018, McCarty remained involved in the sport, taking on a coaching role with the Eskimos and working with young players to help them develop their skills.

During the postseason in 2018, McCarty's leadership and experience were crucial for the Eskimos. He played a key role in opening up opportunities for the quarterback and tailback, who became a formidable rushing duo in the league. Under McCarty's guidance, the Eskimos achieved three straight playoff appearances, reaching the Grey Cup championship game in 2018 but ultimately losing to the Toronto Argonauts.

Officers had brought their personal slaves with them, including Captain Swords.", "gold": "The border with Missouri was east of Fort Scott. In Missouri was a grog shop that supplied soldiers, and quite a few courts-martial followed soldiers' going AWOL at the shop. The desertion rate from the fort ranged from 12\u201316%, due to boredom, irregular pay, and hatred for military life. As no combat took place near the fort, it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base. Hunting was a popular pastime; according to Captain Swords, \"wolf chasing and duck hunting\" was the only way one officer could tolerate the place. Two years after the army abandoned the fort, the buildings were sold by auction to civilians, with two being converted to hotels. In 1854 the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had kept slavery out of Kansas. Missourians in favor of slavery soon moved to Kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not Kansas would permit slavery. Settlers from New England arrived equally determined to keep it out. Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort Scott: Free-Soil at the Fort Scott Hotel and Pro-Slavery at the Western Hotel. Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery, but those outside the town tended to the free-soil side. During this time, there were local incidents of murder and attempted arson, typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting. During the American Civil War, the fort was renewed as a US military post. In August 1861, the Union Army took command of Fort Scott, and readied it for the war times. The United States Army also took over several blocks within the town for commissary and quartermaster functions. The Union Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners. Troops from Indiana, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, and Wisconsin would come to the fort, and either stayed by the fort, or traveled farther, to subjugate Missouri, Arkansas, or the Indian Territory. Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the United States Colored Troops of the Union Army. A major supply depot was situated at the fort. Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town, but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek.", "text1": "Captain Swords' slave, a quiet and reserved woman named Emilia, had been with him since his days in the colonies. She had been a gift from his father, a wealthy planter who had owned a plantation in Virginia. Emilia was a skilled seamstress and cook, and had always been diligent in her duties, but there was a subtle sadness in her eyes that Captain Swords couldn't quite understand. He had often wondered if it was the result of being torn from her family and homeland, or if there was something more to it, something she kept hidden deep within herself.\n\nAs the days passed, Emilia became increasingly withdrawn, spending long hours alone in her small quarters, her usual needlework and cooking replaced by long, contemplative silences. Captain Swords grew concerned, but Emilia refused to speak of her troubles, and he was powerless to help her.\n\nOne night, as the moon hung low in the sky, Emilia slipped out of the fort, leaving behind a note for Captain Swords, simply written: \"I must see it.\" The captain was torn between his duty to keep her safe and his desire to understand what was driving her away. He followed her, tracking her through the darkness until she finally stopped at the edge of a small clearing.\n\nIn the center of the clearing stood an old, gnarled tree, its branches twisted and tangled in a way that seemed almost... human. Emilia approached the tree slowly, her eyes fixed on something that only she could see. Captain Swords watched in awe as she reached out a hand, hesitated, then gently touched the trunk of the tree.

The Captain's eyes scanned the room, her mind already calculating the fort's remaining resources, before she turned to Akira with a firm yet gentle hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"See that the stores are properly organized, Akira,\" she instructed, her low, smooth voice carrying across the room. \"We may be here for some time yet, and every ounce of grain, every pound of meat... matters more than ever.", "text3": "Captain Swords walked out of the commandant's quarters at sunset with her silent and brooding personal slave, Akira, following closely behind.

Federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology. Government publications on the dangers of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, in large part because of public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services. An area of widespread concern in the German media has been the alleged \"infiltration\" of businesses by Scientologists, in line with Scientology's declared aim to penetrate society, politics and business in preparation for world domination. Attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium-size companies, such as estate agents, management consultants and management-training companies. Management-consultancy firms led by Scientologists often conceal their association with Scientology; once they have recruited members of their clients' upper management, these managers may send employees to Scientology trainers, as part of company education and training programmes, without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used. An expensive commercial version of Scientology's Oxford Capacity Analysis, usually offered free as part of Scientology proselytizing in public places, temporarily entered some major German companies (who were unaware of its provenance) via such a management-consultancy firm. In the mid-2000s, German sect experts expressed concerns that Scientologists were becoming active in the German after-school tutoring market.", "text1": "As the political and social pressure mounted, the German government took steps to officially declare Scientology a \"danger to the state\" and banned it from operating in the country. In 2008, the German Constitutional Court ruled that the ban was unconstitutional, but the government continued to restrict Scientology's activities and subjected its members to intense scrutiny.\n\nIn response, the Church of Scientology launched a series of high-profile lawsuits against the German government, claiming that its policies were a violation of freedom of religion and expression. The lawsuits garnered significant international attention and put pressure on the German government to reconsider its stance on Scientology.\n\nDespite these efforts, the tensions between the Church of Scientology and the German government continued to escalate. In 2013, the Church's international headquarters in Clearwater, Florida, launched a new anti-German campaign, accusing the government of engaging in \"anti-religious bigotry\" and calling for international intervention.\n\nThe controversy had far-reaching consequences, straining diplomatic relations between Germany and the United States, as well as sparking heated debates about the role of religion in modern society.

In 1525, the Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s passed within a few kilometres of the ruins of Tikal but did not mention them in his letters. After Spanish friar Andr\u00e9s de Avenda\u00f1o became lost in the Pet\u00e9n forests in early 1696 he described a ruin that may well have been Tikal. As is often the case with huge ancient ruins, knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people never forgot about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto M\u00e9ndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Pet\u00e9n, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s. In 1951, a small airstrip was built at the ruins, which previously could only be reached by several days' travel through the jungle on foot or mule. In 1956 the Tikal project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area.

While the notion of a meteorological drought is not new, the specific role it may have played in the abandonment of the city is a significant shift in understanding. The discovery of algae blooms in some of the reservoirs suggests that the drought may have been particularly severe, lasting longer than previously thought.\n\nFurthermore, the finding of mercury-bearing cinnabar on the buildings adds a new layer of complexity to the story. The use of cinnabar, a highly toxic substance, raises questions about the environmental and health impacts on the people who lived and worked in Tikal. The washing off of these paints by rain may have not only polluted the reservoirs but also contaminated the water supply.\n\nResearchers are now working to analyze the mercury levels in the soil and water samples to better understand the extent of the contamination. This new information may also shed light on the relationship between the rulers and the common people, as it is likely that the elite class was more aware of the risks associated with the use of cinnabar and may have taken steps to mitigate its effects.\n\nThe investigation into the decline of Tikal is ongoing, but these latest findings are providing a more nuanced understanding of the factors that contributed to the abandonment of the city.

Other potential factors that may have contributed to the city's abandonment include overexploitation of the city's resources, conflict, and environmental degradation.\n\nAdditionally, the discovery of mercury-bearing paint on the buildings suggests a more sophisticated understanding of the city's inhabitants' knowledge of art and science.

Dr. Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, the project's lead researcher, suggested that the residents of Tikal were likely facing considerable difficulties and distress as a result of the drought. The varying impact of the drought on different reservoirs indicates that there was inconsistency in the water supply, posing challenges for a city dependent on agriculture. The drought had varying effects on different reservoirs, creating challenges for a city reliant on farming. The researchers emphasize that while the drought was not the only reason for the city's abandonment, it was likely a contributing factor to its decline. Additional reasons for the city's abandonment could have been excessive use of resources, conflict, and environmental damage.

The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs, troop movement, as well as paratroop and leaflet drops, while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist (CT) jungle bases. The RAAF were particularly successful, and in one such mission known as Operation Termite, five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps, killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender, in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops. The Lincolns were withdrawn in 1958, and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron and CAC Sabres from No. 78 Wing.

Australian ground forces were deployed to Malaya in October 1955 as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. In January 1956, the first Australian ground forces were deployed on Malaysian peninsula, consisting of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR). 2 RAR mainly participated in \"mopping up\" operations over the next 20 months, conducting extensive patrolling in and near the CT jungle bases, as part of 28th British Commonwealth Brigade. Contact with the enemy was infrequent and results small, achieving relatively few kills. 2 RAR left Malaysia October 1957 to be replaced by 3 RAR. 3 RAR underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving MCP insurgents back into the jungle of Perak and Kedah. The new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes. Again contact was limited, although 3 RAR had more success than its predecessor.

It is closely related to the American lobster, H. americanus.", "gold": "It may grow to a length of and a mass of , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws. In life the lobsters are blue, only becoming \"lobster red\" on cooking. Mating occurs in the summer, producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae. Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food, and is widely caught using lobster pots, mostly around the British Isles. Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean, with a body length up to and weighing up to , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually long and weigh . Like other crustaceans, lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow, in a process called ecdysis (molting). This may occur several times a year for young lobsters, but decreases to once every 1\u20132 years for larger animals. The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large, asymmetrical pair of feet. The larger one is the \"crusher\", and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the \"cutter\", which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. Usually, the left claw is the crusher, and the right is the cutter. The exoskeleton is generally blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment. The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap. The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics: The rostrum of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in H. gammarus. The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red-tipped, while those of H. gammarus are white or white-tipped.", "text1": "The European lobster is a prized catch in many coastal communities, with a long history of commercial and recreational fishing.

The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has established a minimum catch limit for European lobster fishing to help conserve the species and maintain a sustainable fishery.\n\nThe European lobster is also an important part of the marine ecosystem, playing a key role in maintaining the balance of its habitat. It is a predator of many invertebrates, including crabs, shrimp, and mollusks, and is itself preyed upon by larger fish and marine mammals.\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect the European lobster and its habitat. Marine protected areas have been established in many parts of its range, and measures have been taken to reduce bycatch and minimize the impact of fishing gear on the ocean floor.

He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835. Lindsay's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe. There are good examples of horizontal water mills, also known as Norse or Clack Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill-stone was sited.

They built a new wing to house additional machinery and hired more employees to help with the workload. The mill continued to thrive, and the Peverett family became respected members of the community.\n\nIn 1890, Edward Peverett, Stephen's son, returned from his apprenticeship in London and joined his father at the mill. He brought new ideas and techniques, which further improved the mill's efficiency and productivity. Under the guidance of Edward and Stephen, the mill continued to flourish, and the Peverett family remained at the helm until the early 20th century, when the mill was sold to a large milling company.\n\nDespite the change in ownership, the Peverett family's legacy lived on, and the mill remained an important part of the local community for many years.", "text2": "...who continued to run the mill until 1890, when it was sold to the Norfolk and Yorkshire Co-operative Milk Company.

However, fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the 1870s on.", "gold": "At this time another duel entered the history of Papa Stour. Edwin Lindsay, an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres, was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one. He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835. Lindsay's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe. There are good examples of horizontal water mills, also known as Norse or Clack Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill-stone was sited. Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone, and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below. Some were still in use on Papa Stour in the early years of the 20th century, and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of Clumlie, at Troswick in the south Mainland of Shetland. In common with many small Scottish islands, Papa Stour's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then (see e.g. Mingulay). By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen 'fairly elderly' residents, but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline. A croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants. By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33. However, by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases. A number of people left the island and the school closed. By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left. The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2001-11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. The coasts around Papa Stour have claimed numerous wrecks. In Hamnavoe, Tiptans Skerry alone has sunk Dutch, French, German and Norwegian ships. The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran A178, foundered on the Ve Skerries 3 miles northwest of Papa Stour, on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of Scalloway to land her catch.", "text1": "By the early 20th century, the Crabbaberry fishing station had closed, and many of the island's residents had moved to the mainland or other islands to seek work in the fishing industry.

Despite this, the island's residents remained fiercely proud of their heritage and worked hard to maintain their traditional way of life.\n\nIn the 1920s, the island's community came together to establish a cooperative shop and post office, which helped to improve the islanders' access to goods and services. The shop also served as a hub for social events, with the island's residents gathering there to celebrate special occasions and share news and gossip.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the British government began to take an interest in Papa Westray's unique cultural heritage, and the island was designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. This recognition helped to attract tourists to the island, and a small but steady stream of visitors began to arrive each summer to explore the island's ancient ruins and experience its unique way of life.\n\nDespite these changes, the island's residents continued to face challenges in maintaining their traditional way of life. The decline of the fishing industry had left many without steady employment, and the island's infrastructure was in need of repair. However, the island's community remained resilient, and in the 1970s, a group of residents came together to form the Papa Westray Community Trust, which aimed to promote the island's cultural heritage and develop sustainable economic initiatives.\n\nToday, Papa Westray remains a small but vibrant community, with a population of around 70 people. While the island's economy is still heavily reliant on tourism, the community trust has helped to establish a range of initiatives, from craft workshops to fishing cooperatives, to support the island's residents and preserve its unique cultural heritage. Despite the challenges it has faced over the years, Papa Westray remains a special place, where the past and present come together in a unique and vibrant way.", "text2": "As the years went on, the island's once thriving fishing industry began to dwindle, and many of the island's residents were forced to leave in search of work. The population dwindled to around 100 by the mid-20th century, and by the 1970s, the island was largely abandoned.\n\nBut in the late 1970s, a group of forward-thinking conservationists recognized the island's unique natural beauty and historical significance. They banded together to form the Shetland Islands Council, a organization dedicated to preserving and protecting Scotland's Outer Isles, including Whalsay.\n\nUnder their watchful eye, the council began a massive restoration effort, aiming to revitalize the island's crumbling infrastructure and revitalize its natural habitats. The project, dubbed \"Project Whalsay,\" was a massive undertaking that took several decades to complete but paid off in the end.\n\nToday, Whalsay is a thriving island community once again, with a population of over 200 people and a strong focus on conservation and sustainability.

Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first Harry Potter film. Some fellow pupils became hostile, though he says they were just trying to \"have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter\" rather than acting out of jealousy. As his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors.

It's all part of his grandiose sense of self-esteem, which is probably masking a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with Kurt, and all kinds of other things.

Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art. The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits, 20th century photography, and several sculptures. The Meridian Council for the Arts (MCA) was founded as Meridian's and Lauderdale County's official arts agency in 1978. MCA operates its Community Art Grants program, the annual Threefoot Festival, several workshops, and other special events each year. MCA is partnered with many arts organizations in the city and county including the Meridian Museum of Art, the Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. Meridian Little Theatre, one of the South's oldest subscription-based community theatres, was built in 1932 and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County, entertaining over 22,000 guests each season, making it Mississippi's most-attended community theatre.

In 1965 the MSO booked its first international soloist, Elena Nikolaidi, to perform with the orchestra. The Orchestra helped the Meridian Public School District develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus. The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox Hillard, who has been with the orchestra since 1991. The MSO will celebrate its 50th anniversary in February 2011 with a performance from Itzhak Perlman. The city's former Grand Opera House was built in 1889 by two half brothers, Israel Marks and Levi Rothenberg.

Signposts act as checkpoints to allow Sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life. The time resets when he returns to the checkpoint. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player may return to the beginning of the act with three lives if the player has any continues. Scattered around each level are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings act as a layer of protection against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, all his rings will scatter. He can recollect some of them again before they disappear. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling into bottomless pits, or running out of time, kill Sonic regardless of rings or other protection. The game is split into six principal zones, followed by a short 'Final Zone.' Each main zone has its own visual style, and while some enemies appear throughout, each zone has unique enemies and obstacles. Each main zone is split into three acts, all of which must be completed. At the end of each main zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik for a boss fight. For most of the fights, Robotnik's vehicle is fitted with different weapons. After completing the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the single-level \"Final Zone\" for a last encounter with Robotnik inside a large machine environment.

However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it (which was flying a truce flag), and it was not delivered until the next day.

The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6 km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at the northern end of Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan. General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17. An attempt to wade the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder-deep, too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition. He considered using boats to ferry the troops across, but the Americans, with timely advice from General Lee, adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position. As a result, the British and American forces faced each other across the channel, engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range.

Further aligning himself with Britain's glam rock movement, Starr made his directorial debut with Born to Boogie, a film starring Bolan that included Starr's footage of a T. Rex concert held at Wembley on 18 March 1972. The song was a hit in the US, peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100, and achieved Starr's best position on the UK Singles Chart, where it reached number 2.

The clip shows Starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by a Frankenstein-like monster; it was directed by Tom Taylor and financed by Caravel Films. A similar-looking monster appeared on the single's picture sleeve, holding a cigarette. Referring to the film clip, Jackson writes: \"the Frankenstein monster stalks Starr but in the end the two hug and dance together, as thankfully, he and McCartney eventually did, leading to many more collaborations over the next forty years.\" Re-releases for \"Back Off Boogaloo\" include Starr's 1975 greatest hits album, Blast from Your Past, and, along with \"Blindman\", as a bonus track on the 1992 reissue of his Goodnight Vienna album. \"Back Off Boogaloo\" also appeared on his 2007 compilation Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr, the collector's edition of which included the 1972 promotional film.

Jablonsk\u00fd gained fame as attorney of Yekta Uzunoglu, a Kurdish national who was first charged in 1994 with preparing to commit three murders and committing blackmail and torture. It became one of the longest criminal cases in the Czech history, as the witnesses and alleged victims gradually withdrew or changed their testimonies against Uzunoglu until he was exonerated by the Municipal Court in Prague in 2007. The court held that although the crimes did take place, there is no evidence that Uzunoglu took part in it. He was also defending judge Pavel Nagy, who was indicted of accepting a bribe. The proceedings ended with Nagy being found insane and criminally not liable. Jablonsk\u00fd also acted as a defense attorney in the case of a hairdresser of Czech VIPs indicted on charges of rape and torture. During the proceedings, the judge sent Jablonsk\u00fd to face the disciplinary commission of the Czech bar association for what he perceived as \"behaviour bordering on contempt\". The trial started on February 4, 2013. Blythe testified that when he wanted to see the club before the concert, Lamb of God's technician told him that the club was terrible and messy. According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that the stage was small, there were too many people, and that it was rather dangerous. Blythe, who is nearsighted, took off his glasses before entering the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Po\u0159\u00e1dek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security.

A larger rerouting was completed in 1933 between Rogers Park and Sault Ste. Marie. The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to Cedarville and north to Sault Ste. Marie; the former routing was given the M\u2011121 designation. Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2/US 141 to a new bridge over the Menominee River between 1932 and 1934. Downtown Ironwood was bypassed in 1934, and the former route was initially designated M\u201154. The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) changed the routings and designations of the highways around Cooks, Thompson and Manistique in the mid-1930s. The agency rerouted US 2 between Cooks and M\u2011149 in Thompson, turning the old road back to county control. The section between M\u2011149 and M\u2011125 was redesignated as an extension of M\u2011149 to Thompson, and M\u2011125 was replaced by a further extension of M\u2011149. The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area, completing the changes on August 2, 1936. The MSHD started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted US 2 into St. Ignace for the first time. Between Brevort and Moran, US 2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the Tahquamenon Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula. The new routing took US 2 along the lakeshore into St. Ignace. US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M\u2011122. Further changes in the early 1940s straightened the roadway out near Watersmeet and Crystal Falls. Additional realignments were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern lakeshore routing between Gould City and Epoufette in 1941. The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to Naubinway and then along the lake to Epoufette. The former route through Engadine was turned back to local control as far east as Garnet. From there east, it was numbered just M\u201148, removing US 2 from a concurrency.

Meanwhile, M-48 was truncated to its current southern terminus at M-95 in Rexton, with the section north to Garnet being re-designated as an extension of M-69. Additionally, a new designation was introduced: M-69 was extended south from M-48 in Rexton to its current southern terminus at M-28 in Quinnesec, replacing a portion of US 2 that had previously been used as a temporary routing for M-48.

Ireland led 3\u20130 at half-time after scoring a converted try, but the Natives improved considerably in the second-half, scoring four tries. Patrick Keogh scored the first two tries, and his play was praised by the local press. The third try scored was by Thomas Ellison after a counter-attack by George Williams. The try was not converted, but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the visitors a 13\u20134 victory. The Irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team, but Ireland did go on to defeat Wales two tries to nil in the 1889 Home Nations Championship. Following their defeat of Ireland, the Natives played Trinity College and then North of Ireland. The match against Trinity College was drawn 4\u20134, and despite Keogh not playing, the Native side played much better than their previous fixture.

Churchill's assertions have been raised as one of the several research-misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 (see below). He has been accused of using his interpretation of the Dawes Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member. Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture, and what he describes as the genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the Americas by European-American settlers and the ongoing repression of native peoples. According to the University of Colorado investigation, \"His academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and reinterpretation, drawing upon studies by other scholars, not monographs describing new research based on primary sources.\" The investigation also noted that \"he has decided to publish largely in alternative presses or journals, not in the university presses or mainstream peer-reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics.\" In addition to his academic writing, Churchill has written for several general readership magazines of political opinion. In 1986, Churchill wrote an essay titled Pacifism as Pathology: Notes on an American Pseudopraxis criticizing pacifist politics within the U.S. left as being hypocritical, de facto racist and ineffectual. In 1998, Arbeiter Ring Publishing published the essay in a book entitled Pacifism as Pathology: Reflections on the Role of Armed Struggle in North America and listing Ward Churchill as the author.

Nevertheless, his assertions have continued to resonate with many indigenous communities, who have long protested the use of blood quantum laws to determine their citizenship and access to resources.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing movement among Native American tribes to repeal or reform blood quantum laws, which many see as perpetuating internalized racism and eroding tribal identity. Proponents of reform argue that these laws have been used to deny citizenship to many individuals who are \"too Indian\" or \"not Indian enough,\" and that they perpetuate a culture of assimilation and erasure.\n\nMeanwhile, Churchill's critics argue that his views are overly focused on conspiracy and neglect the historical context in which blood quantum laws were enacted. Some scholars have pointed out that the use of blood quantum laws was, in part, a response to the needs of indigenous communities themselves, who sought to clarify and strengthen their identities and relationships to their ancestral lands.\n\nDespite these debates, Churchill's work continues to be widely cited and influential, and his arguments have helped to galvanize a new generation of Native American activists and scholars who are seeking to challenge the status quo and promote greater justice and recognition for indigenous peoples.

Sonic Team also intended to include a sound test with animations of Sonic breakdancing to a band of animal characters; including a crocodile keyboardist who was later introduced into the series as Vector the Crocodile in Knuckles' Chaotix in 1995. The sound test was scrapped for time reasons and Naka used the freed up memory to add the \"Se-ga!\" chant used in TV commercials as a startup sound. Naka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code. Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty. Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly.

Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley rewrote the script in 2010, and the project went into production with Seth Gordon directing. Production designer Shepherd Frankel specifically set out to create distinctly different environments for the three employees and their respective bosses' homes and offices. Nick and Harken's workplace is the \"Comnidyne\" bullpen, which was designed to \"enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower-level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office.\" The design team met with financial strategists and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low-ranking position in a cubicle and aspiring to an office. Costume designer Carol Ramsey worked with Frankel and set decorator Jan Pascale to match Harken's suit to that of the surrounding \"cold grey and blue\" color palette of his office. Harken's home was described as \"equally lacking in warmth\" as the office but more lavishly decorated and \"for show\", including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his \"trophy wife\". Designing Julia's office was described as a \"challenge\", infusing a \"sensual vibe\" into a dental office.

On 9 July, the 15th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around Siskatekori, at the junction of the Mivo River and the Buin Road, which included a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment. Australian patrols were resumed in late July and continued into August. These attacks proved very costly, particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding. Fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also, and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards Buin continued into August, combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed. As a result, the final Australian operations on Bougainville took place on the Ratsua front in the northern sector, where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at Porton Plantation had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the Bonis Peninsula. By mid-August, however, following the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japan's subsequent unconditional surrender, a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this, it spelt an end to major combat operations. Following the end of the war, the Australian Army awarded three battle honours for the fighting around the Hongorai River. The 2/4th Armoured Regiment, and the 9th, 24th, 57th/60th and 58th/59th Infantry Battalions received the battle honour \"Hongorai River\".", "text1": "As the 29th Brigade took over the front line, they assessed the situation and identified key objectives to capture, including the heavily fortified village of Salamaua. The village was crucial to the Japanese supply lines and held significant strategic value, making it a high priority target for the Australian forces.\n\nOn July 12, the 2/4th Battalion, part of the 29th Brigade, launched a bold assault on Salamaua, supported by artillery and air power. Despite fierce Japanese resistance, the Australians made significant gains, slowly but surely pushing the enemy back. By the end of the day, they had secured a foothold in the village, but the fighting was far from over.\n\nOver the next few days, the Australians continued to fight house-to-house, clearing the village of Japanese troops. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. On July 15, the 2/4th Battalion finally secured the village, but not before the Japanese had blown up their supplies and retreated to nearby hills.\n\nWith Salamaua in Australian hands, the focus shifted to securing the surrounding area and cutting off Japanese supply lines. The 29th Brigade, along with supporting units, began to push deeper into the Wairopi Valley, seeking to encircle the Japanese forces and trap them against the river. As the Australians advanced, they encountered more Japanese entrenchments, which they attacked with a combination of infantry, artillery, and air power.

The following day, the 15th Brigade launched a final push to eliminate the remaining Japanese resistance, and after a day of fierce fighting, the island was finally declared secure.\n\nWith the island secured, the Australians began to focus on the construction of air strips and bases, essential for future operations. The 24th Brigade took charge of the construction efforts, with the 2/10th Battalion responsible for securing the sensitive radio communications network. As the weeks passed, the island became a key hub for Allied operations in the region, providing vital air support and intelligence gathering services to troops operating in the Pacific.\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese, who had lost over 1,500 soldiers during the battle, were in retreat, fleeing the island in disarray.

Between Brevort and Moran, US 2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the Tahquamenon Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula. The new routing took US 2 along the lakeshore into St. Ignace. US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M\u2011122. Further changes in the early 1940s straightened the roadway out near Watersmeet and Crystal Falls. Additional realignments were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern lakeshore routing between Gould City and Epoufette in 1941. The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to Naubinway and then along the lake to Epoufette. The former route through Engadine was turned back to local control as far east as Garnet. From there east, it was numbered just M\u201148, removing US 2 from a concurrency. Another former section into Epoufette was added to extend M\u2011117. The new highway was detoured around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II. The western end of US 2 took on two changes in the 1940s. M\u201128 was extended along US 2 to the state line at Ironwood from its western terminus at Wakefield. A similar extension was made from M\u201128's eastern terminus to Sault Ste. Marie in 1948. The M\u201154 designation was renumbered as Business US 2 by 1945. The eastern M\u201128 extension was reversed in 1950, and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952. With the coming of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan, the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of US 2 to a freeway between St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie. In planning maps from 1947, this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the Interstates. It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, that was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system.", "text1": "Following the realignment of US 2, the department of highways began to focus on upgrading the road's infrastructure to accommodate the increased traffic volume. In 1937, a new four-lane section of M-149 was constructed between Thompson and the Indiana border, featuring a 12-foot wide paved surface and improved drainage systems.\n\nThe next major improvement came in the early 1940s, when the Michigan State Highway Department undertook a major reconstruction project to widen and realign US 2 through the Thompson area. The project, which was completed in 1943, involved relocating the highway to a new route that bypassed the town center and improved safety by reducing the number of at-grade intersections.\n\nIn the post-war era, US 2 continued to see significant upgrades and improvements, including the addition of new bridges and culverts, as well as the resurfacing and reconstruction of existing road surfaces. By the 1960s, the highway had become a vital artery for both local and long-distance traffic, connecting the Upper Peninsula to the rest of the state and the nation.\n\nToday, US 2 remains an important transportation corridor, with the Michigan Department of Transportation continuing to invest in its maintenance and improvement.

Despite experiencing arduous conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle, and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties. Australians were involved in actions at Matarikoriko, Pukekohe East, Titi Hill, \u014cr\u0101kau and Te Ranga. Fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action. The conflict was over by 1864, and the Waikato Regiments disbanded in 1867. However, many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade, while many others had returned to Australia. From 1870 until 1901, each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the 1870s\u2014including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units\u2014they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense. By 1885, the forces numbered 21,000 men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century, with the colonies raising contingents to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China. Despite a reputation of colonial inferiority, many of the locally raised units were highly organised, disciplined, professional, and well trained. During this period, defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery, based on garrisoned coastal forts. However, by the 1890s, improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards\u2014who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces\u2014to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry.", "text1": "These regiments, known as the Waikato War Regiments, were transported to New Zealand and played a significant role in the subsequent battles and skirmishes against the M\u0101ori.

The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean.", "gold": "The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands: samples from the Oosterschelde were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel. Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand, alongside other European species such as the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. Between 1904 and 1914, one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin, but the species did not become established there. Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of , although not normally deeper than . They prefer hard substrates, such as rocks or hard mud, and live in holes or crevices, emerging at night to feed. The diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other benthic invertebrates. These include crabs, molluscs, sea urchins, starfish and polychaete worms. The three clawed lobster species Homarus gammarus, H. americanus and Nephrops norvegicus are hosts to the three known species of the animal phylum Cycliophora; the species on H. gammarus has not been described. Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease gaffkaemia, caused by the bacterium Aerococcus viridans. Although it is frequently found in American lobsters, the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus, where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out. Homarus gammarus is traditionally \"highly esteemed\" as a foodstuff and was mentioned in \"The Crabfish\" a seventeenth century English folk song. It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh, frozen, canned or powdered. Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain \"excellent\" white meat, and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible. The exceptions are the gastric mill and the \"sand vein\" (gut). The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus, and the European species is considered to be more flavored. Lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots, although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out, to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand.", "text1": "These Mediterranean lobsters, scientifically known as Homarus galbau, are smaller in size and have a more vibrant coloration compared to their Atlantic counterparts. They are also more tolerant of warmer waters, with a preferred temperature range of 12-18\u00b0C (54-64\u00b0F). In contrast, the Atlantic lobsters, which include the American lobster (Homarus americanus) and the European lobster (Homarus gammarus), thrive in colder waters with temperatures ranging from 2-10\u00b0C (36-50\u00b0F).\n\nDespite their differences, both populations share a unique adaptation to their environments. The \"midnight-sun lobster\" in northern Norway, for example, has evolved to live in the Arctic summer where the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours a day. This prolonged daylight period can be challenging for many marine animals, but the lobsters have developed a thick layer of melanin in their skin to protect themselves from the intense UV radiation. In contrast, the Mediterranean lobsters have adapted to the warm, sun-drenched waters by developing a more reflective exoskeleton that helps them regulate their body temperature.\n\nFurther research has also revealed that these distinct lobster populations have developed different mating habits and reproduction strategies. The \"midnight-sun lobster\" is known to migrate long distances to reach their mating grounds, while the Mediterranean lobsters tend to remain in their native waters and mate in shallower, coastal areas.", "text2": "These Mediterranean Sea lobster populations, often referred to as the \"warm-weather lobsters\", have adapted to the warmer and more saline environment, developing distinct physiological and anatomical characteristics. For instance, the lobsters in the Mediterranean have been found to have a more slender body shape than their northern Norwegian counterparts, allowing them to maneuver more easily in the warmer and more turbid waters.\n\nAdditionally, the Mediterranean lobsters have been shown to have a higher level of metabolic efficiency, allowing them to thrive in environments with limited oxygen availability. This is likely due to the presence of certain microorganisms in the water column that provide them with a source of nutrition, allowing them to reduce their energy expenditure.\n\nResearchers have also found that the Mediterranean lobsters have a unique mating behavior, where males will engage in elaborate courtship displays to attract females. These displays involve complex patterns of color changes, postural adjustments, and even the use of scent signals to communicate with potential mates.", "text3": "The Mediterranean Sea lobster populations, known as \"warm-weather lobsters\", have adjusted to the warmer and saltier environment by developing unique physical traits. One example is that Mediterranean lobsters have a slimmer body shape compared to lobsters in Norway, which helps them move more effectively in the warmer and murkier waters. Moreover, Mediterranean lobsters exhibit increased metabolic efficiency, enabling them to flourish in low-oxygen environments. The reason for this is probably the microorganisms in the water that give them food, helping them conserve energy.

Within an hour the Japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship, badly wounded the fleet commander, Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, knocked out her rear 12-inch gun turret, and jammed Knyaz Suvorovs steering so that she fell out of formation. The Russian ships were concentrating their fire on Mikasa during the early part of the battle and Asahi was not damaged during this time. T\u014dg\u014d was able to cross the T of the Russian squadrons. Knyaz Suvorovs steering was later repaired, but she blundered between the Japanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged. Asahi seems to have mostly engaged the battleships and in the late stages of the battle, although fired the shots that caused the Borodinos magazines to explode and sink her. Asahi fired more twelve-inch shells, 142, than any other ship during the battle. In total, the ship was hit six times during the battle, but none of them damaged her significantly. Asahi lost 1 officer and 6 men, 5 men seriously wounded, 1 officer and 18 men lightly wounded. In total, the Japanese only lost 110 men killed and 590 wounded to all causes during the battle. The battle was a total Japanese victory with five Russian battleships captured and incorporated into the IJN. Captain W. C. Pakenham, the Royal Navy's official military observer under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, took notes of the battle's progress from a deck chair on Asahis exposed quarterdeck. His report confirmed the superiority of Japanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the West.", "text1": "As the Russian squadron limped back to Port Arthur, the officers and crew were left reeling from the sudden loss of momentum. The disaster was compounded by the fact that the Japanese had seemingly vanished into thin air, leaving no signs of pursuit or battle damage.\n\nCaptain Nikolai von Essen, commander of the flagship Petropavlovsk, was beside himself with frustration and anger. He knew that the sudden halt had allowed the Japanese to get the better of them, and he couldn't shake the feeling that they had been outmaneuvered and outgunned.\n\nThe crew was equally demoralized, their spirits crushed by the unexpected turn of events. Many had been wounded or killed in the brief battle, and the survivors were left to pick up the pieces and regroup.\n\nAs the squadron limped back into Port Arthur, the Russian naval authorities were left scrambling to regroup and reassess their strategy. Admiral Stepan Makarov, the commander-in-chief of the Russian Pacific Fleet, was summoned to the scene to investigate the disaster and determine the extent of the damage.\n\nIn the meantime, the Japanese fleet, led by Admiral Heihachiro Togo, was already making plans to take advantage of their unexpected advantage.

Captain Nikolai Loginov, a seasoned naval commander, stood on the quarterdeck, his face a picture of frustration and worry. \"How long until we can free ourselves?\" he demanded of the engineer, who was examining the jammed wheel.\n\n\"Not more than an hour, Captain,\" replied the engineer, scratching his head thoughtfully. \"But I fear the wheel may be bent, and we'll need to send for a team of divers to assess the extent of the damage.\"\n\nCaptain Loginov nodded grimly. \"Very well. Send out the distress signal and prepare a team to inspect the wheel once the divers have reported back. We can't stay here in the open any longer than necessary.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rear Admiral Ukhtomsky had already arrived back in Port Arthur, where he reported the day's unfortunate events to Admiral Stepan Makarov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Pacific Fleet. The admiral listened intently, his face growing increasingly grim.\n\n\"I fear this is a setback of the utmost seriousness,\" he declared. \"We cannot afford to lose a whole day's reconnaissance, and with the Japanese sinking ships left and right, we risk being caught off our guard. We must send out reconnaissance missions immediately to reconvene with the disabled battleship and gather intelligence on the Japanese naval movements.\"\n\nUkhtomsky nodded sharply. \"Yes, Admiral. I shall personally lead the relief mission to retrieve Captain Loginov's ship and gather crucial intel on the Japanese fleet.\"\n\nWith a plan in place, the Russian Pacific Fleet sprang into action, sending out patrols to scour the sea lanes and gather vital information, all the while aware that time was running out in the race to secure the strategic waters of the Yellow Sea and prevent a crippling defeat at the hands of the Japanese.", "text3": "While the Russian squadron was heading back to Port Arthur's harbor for safety, the crew of the damaged battleship was working hard to untangle it from the debris. Captain Nikolai Loginov, an experienced naval officer, looked concerned and frustrated as he stood on the quarterdeck. He asked the engineer inspecting the stuck wheel how much longer it would take to untangle the battleship. The engineer estimated it would take less than an hour to untangle the battleship, responding to Captain Loginov's question. \"I'm worried that the wheel might be damaged, so we may have to call in divers to check the severity of the situation.\" Captain Loginov nodded solemnly. \"Understood.\" Issue a distress signal and get a team ready to examine the wheel after the divers have given their report. We need to minimize our time out in the open. Rear Admiral Ukhtomsky had returned to Port Arthur and informed Admiral Stepan Makarov of the day's events. The admiral paid close attention, his expression becoming more serious. He expressed concern about the severity of the setback. Losing a day of reconnaissance is not an option, especially with the Japanese sinking ships and catching us off guard. We need to dispatch reconnaissance missions right away to regroup with the damaged battleship and gather information on the Japanese navy's activities. Ukhtomsky gave a quick nod. \"Affirmative, Admiral.\" I will take charge of the mission to rescue Captain Loginov's ship and gather important information about the Japanese fleet.

{"prefix": "The early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city, known only as the \"Lady of Tikal\", who was very likely a daughter of Chak Tok Ich'aak II. She seems never to have ruled in her own right, rather being partnered with male co-rulers.", "gold": "The first of these was Kaloomte' B'alam, who seems to have had a long career as a general at Tikal before becoming co-ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence. The Lady of Tikal herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering. It appears she was later paired with lord \"Bird Claw\", who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler. In the mid 6th century, Caracol seems to have allied with Calakmul and defeated Tikal, closing the Early Classic. The \"Tikal hiatus\" refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large-scale construction at Tikal. In the latter half of the 6th century AD, a serious crisis befell the city, with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture. This hiatus in activity at Tikal was long unexplained until later epigraphic decipherments identified that the period was prompted by Tikal's comprehensive defeat at the hands of Calakmul and the Caracol polity in AD 562, a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of Tikal. The badly eroded Altar 21 at Caracol described how Tikal suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in April 562. It seems that Caracol was an ally of Calakmul in the wider conflict between that city and Tikal, with the defeat of Tikal having a lasting impact upon the city. Tikal was not sacked but its power and influence were broken. After its great victory, Caracol grew rapidly and some of Tikal's population may have been forcibly relocated there. During the hiatus period, at least one ruler of Tikal took refuge with Janaab' Pakal of Palenque, another of Calakmul's victims. Calakmul itself thrived during Tikal's long hiatus period. The beginning of the Tikal hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly subdivide the Classic period of Mesoamerican chronology into the Early and Late Classic.", "text1": "As the \"Lady of Tikal\", she was a figure shrouded in mystery, with many believing that she was a mere pawn in the complex web of Mayan politics. Despite being the daughter of a great king, she was never referred to as \"Lady of Tikal\" in her own right, only in conjunction with the male rulers she was paired with. It was as if her position was one of inferiority, a mere accessory to the true power holders.\n\nHowever, some historians have suggested that the Lady of Tikal may have been more than just a figurehead. With her connections to the royal family and her experience in the court of her father, she may have played a crucial role in advising and guiding the male rulers, using her knowledge and influence to shape the course of Tikal's history.\n\nOne theory is that she was responsible for the rapid expansion of Tikal's borders during this period, using her diplomatic skills to forge alliances with neighboring city-states and secure valuable trade agreements. Her ability to navigate the complex web of Mayan politics may have been instrumental in Tikal's rise to prominence, and her legacy may have been far greater than initially thought.\n\nDespite these theories, the Lady of Tikal remains an enigmatic figure, and her true role in Mayan history will likely never be fully known. Her story serves as a reminder that even in the midst of great power and influence, there were often women who played a significant, if unseen, role in shaping the course of history.", "text2": "The Lady of Tikal's reign, though brief, had a profound impact on the city's architecture and culture. During her time, the construction of the North Platform, a grand ceremonial center, was initiated.

The Lady of Tikal's male co-rulers also oversaw significant expansion of the city's trade networks, strengthening ties with nearby cities like Calakmul and Caracol.

The mountains are about directly southwest of Boise, Idaho, and about northeast of Reno, Nevada. The range and surrounding non-mountainous areas cover an area of . The mountains run north to south and east to west. More of the range is in Oregon (78%) than in Nevada (22%). The highest point in the range is Orevada View Benchmark, which is above sea level and is located in Nevada about one mile south of the Oregon border. About two miles southeast of Orevada View is Disaster Peak, \"a large, symmetrical butte that is visible throughout the region.\" At , Disaster Peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub-range called The Granites. The Oregon Canyon Mountains border the Trout Creek Mountains on the east along the Harney\u2013Malheur county line (according to the United States Geological Survey's definitions), while the Pueblo Mountains are the next range west of the Trout Creek Mountains. The Bilk Creek Mountains in both Oregon and Nevada border the Trout Creek Mountains on the southwest; the two ranges are separated by Log Cabin Creek and South Fork Cottonwood Creek. South of the Trout Creek Mountains is the Kings River Valley, which separates the Bilk Creek Mountains on the west from the Montana Mountains on the east. The terrain in the Trout Creek Mountains varies from broad, flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock escarpments cut by deep canyons. The canyons have steep walls with loose talus slopes at the bottoms. There are meadows around springs in the mountains, although most streams in the range do not flow year-round. Major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include (from west to east) Cottonwood Creek, Trout Creek, Willow Creek, and Whitehorse Creek. These streams all flow into endorheic basins in Harney County, Oregon. Trout Creek and Whitehorse Creek are the largest of the four.

{"prefix": "The oldest parts of Capel Lligwy date from the first half of the 12th century. This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north-west Wales were first built in stone following the end of Viking raids and attempts by the Normans to gain control of the island.", "gold": "The reason for its construction, and the saint to whom it was dedicated, are unknown. Geraint Jones, author of a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey, suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel, or connected to a royal court nearby. Yates and Longley, authors of a 2001 guide to ancient Anglesey monuments, note that it was built in the large parish of Penrhos Lligwy and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times. Despite this, it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right. The chapel is sometimes referred to as \"Hen Gapel Lligwy\" (\"hen\" being the Welsh word for \"old\" and \"capel\" meaning \"chapel\"). The walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century, and the upper parts of the walls date from this time. A chapel was added to the south side of the building in the 16th century. A vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family, the Pierce Lloyds. In 1999, the vault was used to record some \"atmospheres\" for the album \"You Have Just Been Poisoned By The Serpents\" by The Serpents, a collective of Welsh musicians including members of Echo and the Bunnymen, Super Furry Animals and Ectogram that was described by one journalist as \"possibly the strangest pop group of all time\". For a time, Capel Lligwy was used as a private place of worship for Lligwy House, a \"venerable mansion\" once owned by the Lloyd family which came into the possession of William Irby, 1st Baron Boston, in the 18th century. After the early part of the 18th century, however, the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair. The walls remain to gable level, with some traces of render on the inside, but the roof has gone. Capel Lligwy is in the Anglesey countryside near Llanallgo; the parish church of St Gallgo, Llanallgo is about away. Part of the churchyard wall remains, showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure, as often found with early churches.", "text1": "As the centuries passed, the church at Capel Lligwy continued to evolve, with several periods of significant renovation and expansion. In the 13th century, the Norman influence is evident in the church's architecture, with the addition of pointed arches and ribbed vaults. During this time, the church also became a significant pilgrimage site, attracting visitors from across the region who sought to venerate the shrine of St. Lligwy, a 7th-century monk who is believed to have been buried on the island.\n\nIn the 15th century, the church underwent a major restoration, which saw the construction of the stunning medieval nave and chancel. The nave, with its intricate stone carvings and ornate roof bosses, is a testament to the skill of the island's medieval masons. The chancel, meanwhile, features a beautiful stained-glass window, which depicts scenes from the life of St. Lligwy.\n\nDespite its beauty and historical significance, Capel Lligwy's fortunes began to decline in the 16th century, as the Reformation and the English Civil War took their toll on the island. The church fell into disrepair, and by the 18th century, it was largely abandoned and used as a farm building.\n\nIt wasn't until the 19th century, with the rise of the Romantic movement and a renewed interest in medieval architecture, that Capel Lligwy began to be restored to its former glory. Today, the church is once again a thriving place of worship, and a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from around the world who come to marvel at its beauty and history.", "text2": "As the island began to flourish once more, the Church of St. Lligwy at Capel Lligwy played a crucial role in the spiritual and social life of the islanders. The simple stone structure, with its Romanesque arches and nave, stood firm against the harsh winds and tides that lapped at its shores, serving as a beacon of hope and community for generations of Anglesey folk. Over time, the church became a center for pilgrimage, with devotees of St. Lligwy's renowned for their fervent devotion and charitable works. The proximity of the sea meant that the island's early Christian settlers had to be skilled fishermen and farmers to sustain themselves, and the church became a natural gathering point for these hardy folk, where they would come to pray for a bountiful catch and a successful harvest. As the years went by, the Church of St. Lligwy evolved, with the addition of stained glass windows and a tower, but its essential purpose remained steadfast - to nurture the souls of the islanders and bind them together as a community.", "text3": "The Church of St. Lligwy at Capel Lligwy was essential to the spiritual and social life of the islanders as the island thrived again.

In its original American broadcast, \"Training Day\" was viewed by an estimated 7.871 million viewers and received a 4.0 rating/11% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 4.0% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a rise in the ratings from the previous episode, \"Garage Sale\", which can be attributed to Ferrell's guest appearance. The episode ranked first in its timeslot, beating the Fox crime drama Bones, which scored a 3.5/10 percent relating in the 18\u201349 demographic; a rerun of the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy and a rerun of the CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. \"Training Day\" received mixed reviews from television critics. IGN writer Cindy White wrote that Deangelo was not given a proper introduction and that he was not distinguished from Michael's character. She also went on to criticize Jim, Pam and Dwight's reaction to Deangelo as the new manager, particular that of Jim and Pam, writing that \"it's becoming painfully obvious that the longtime writers don't know what to do with them anymore\". However, she concluded that the episode continued the seventh season's improvement over the sixth, and that it showed potential for future episodes of the season. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating, denoting a \"good\" episode. The A.V.

{"prefix": "Tikal counterattacked against Dos Pilas in 672, driving B'alaj Chan K'awiil into an exile that lasted five years. Calakmul tried to encircle Tikal within an area dominated by its allies, such as El Peru, Dos Pilas, and Caracol.", "gold": "In 682, Jasaw Chan K'awiil I erected the first dated monument at Tikal in 120 years and claimed the title of kaloomte, so ending the hiatus. He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on Calakmul when, in 695, he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered. After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory. By the 7th century, there was no active Teotihuacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had been razed by 700. Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style. Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today. In 738, Quirigu\u00e1, a vassal of Cop\u00e1n, Tikal's key ally in the south, switched allegiance to Calakmul, defeated Cop\u00e1n and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Cop\u00e1n. In the 8th century, the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis. By the late 8th century and early 9th century, activity at Tikal slowed. Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers. By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline.", "text1": "Despite being exiled, B'alaj Chan K'awiil continued to plot against Tikal from afar.

He led a massive army against Tikal, joined by forces from Calakmul, Dos Pilas, and Caracol. The combined armies laid siege to Tikal, and the city's defenders found themselves vastly outnumbered and outgunned.\n\nThe battle was fierce and intense, with both sides suffering heavy losses. But in the end, B'alaj Chan K'awiil's determination and cunning proved too much for Tikal. The city was breached, and its leaders were forced to flee, leaving their once-great capital to be sacked and plundered by their enemies.\n\nThe defeat was a devastating blow to Tikal, and it marked the beginning of a period of decline and fragmentation for the city. B'alaj Chan K'awiil, meanwhile, solidified his position as the dominant leader of the region, and his city, Calakmul, became the new epicenter of power and influence.

He formed an alliance with Calakmul and its allies, including El Peru, Dos Pilas, and Caracol, and launched a surprise attack on Tikal in 677. The Itza Maya were caught off guard, and Jasaw Chan K'awiil I was forced to flee to the southern lakes of Tabasco.\n\nTikal, reeling from the sudden assault, attempted to regroup under the leadership of Jasaw's trusted advisor, Ahkin Chan Awak. However, the city's defenses had been breached, and its people had lost valuable time. Calakmul and its allies were now firmly established on Tikal's borders, and Ahkin was faced with the daunting task of rebuilding his city and preparing for future conflicts.

His discoveries, such as detailed pottery, jade ornaments, and advanced ball courts, continued to increase interest in the ancient society. At the same time, Dr. Alfonso LaFarge and the Academy of Sciences in Guatemala were actively researching Tikal. The academy's work led to the site being designated as a protected archaeological area, leading to the development of a community of archaeologists, locals, and support personnel near the temple structures. International initiatives in the mid-20th century shifted towards the preservation and excavation of the expansive city. In 1976, Tikal was declared a national monument by the Guatemalan government and designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. Tikal National Park is now a popular destination for tourists and archaeology enthusiasts due to its impressive temples and captivating ambiance.", "detect1": {"z_score": 0.8280786712108251, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.5285714285714286, "p_value": 0.20381297385139047}, "detect2": {"z_score": 8.675834049993263, "prediction": true, "green_fraction": 0.7459807073954984, "p_value": 2.0526522749197682e-18}, "detect3": {"z_score": 1.5130688316720062, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.5457875457875457, "p_value": 0.065131087866026}, "curr_idx": 473}
{"prefix": "Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style. Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1.", "gold": "These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today. In 738, Quirigu\u00e1, a vassal of Cop\u00e1n, Tikal's key ally in the south, switched allegiance to Calakmul, defeated Cop\u00e1n and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Cop\u00e1n. In the 8th century, the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis. By the late 8th century and early 9th century, activity at Tikal slowed. Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers. By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once-great power was little more than a memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem glyph. As Tikal and its hinterland reached peak population, the area suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels.", "text1": "As the reigns of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and Yik'in Chan K'awiil came to a close, the city of Tikal continued to thrive, with its rich cultural heritage and powerful monarchs leaving a lasting legacy. The once-warlike atmosphere began to shift, and the focus turned to diplomatic efforts and trade with neighboring cities. Tikal's artisans and merchants became renowned for their exquisite crafts and luxurious goods, which were highly prized throughout the region.\n\nMeanwhile, the rulers of Calakmul, still seething from their past defeats, began to plot a new course of action. They forged alliances with other rival cities, seeking to weaken Tikal's grip on the region. The stage was set for a new era of conflict, as the two great powers of the region prepared to clash once more.\n\nAs tensions mounted, a young and ambitious king, Chak Toh Ich'aak I, ascended to the throne of Tikal. With a burning desire to prove himself and secure his place in history, he vowed to assert his city's dominance and crush the ambitions of Calakmul once and for all. The fate of Tikal, and the future of the region, hung in the balance as Chak Toh Ich'aak I prepared to unleash a new wave of conquest and glory upon the ancient world.", "text2": "As the reign of Yik'in Chan K'awiil came to an end, he passed the throne to his son, who would become the renowned ruler, K'an B'alan. During his reign, K'an B'alan oversaw significant architectural achievements, including the construction of the impressive Temple I, a grand pyramidal structure dedicated to the god Ah-Chaun-Tikum. The temple's construction was a testament to the city's continued prosperity and its people's skill as master masons and sculptors. The temple's ornate carvings, depicting scenes of warfare, agriculture, and ritual sacrifice, have been studied extensively by archaeologists, providing valuable insight into the city's complex social hierarchy and cosmology.\n\nMeanwhile, the city's relationships with its neighboring kingdoms remained tense, with frequent skirmishes occurring along the borders. However, a period of relative peace did emerge under K'an B'alan's rule, allowing the city to focus on internal development and trade. The Pet\u00e9n lakeside became a thriving center for regional commerce, with merchants arriving from as far away as the Gulf Coast and Mexico's central highlands. The influx of foreign goods and knowledge helped to accelerate cultural diversification within Tikal, incorporating elements such as ceramics, weavings, and metallurgic practices from various parts of the region.\n\nAs the reign of K'an B'alan came to an end, he passed the throne to his son, who would become the last ruler of the Early Classic period at Tikal. The new ruler, who would take on the name Lady Sacred Wildflower, was a skilled diplomat and strategist. She worked tirelessly to maintain alliances with neighboring kingdoms and to promote trade and commerce within the region.

The building of the temple showcased the city's ongoing success and the expertise of its residents in masonry and sculpture. Archaeologists have extensively studied the intricate carvings on the temple, which depict various aspects of life in the city and offer insight into its social structure and beliefs. At the same time, the city continued to have strained relationships with nearby kingdoms, leading to frequent border skirmishes. During K'an B'alan's reign, the city experienced a time of peace that enabled it to prioritize internal growth and commerce. Merchants from distant regions, such as the Gulf Coast and Mexico's central highlands, traveled to the Pet\u00e9n lakeside, which flourished as a hub for regional trade. The introduction of foreign goods and expertise led to increased cultural diversity in Tikal, integrating ceramics, textiles, and metalworking techniques from different areas. K'an B'alan's successor, who would be the final ruler of the Early Classic period in Tikal, took the throne as his reign ended. Lady Sacred Wildflower, the new ruler, was adept at diplomacy and military tactics. She put in a lot of effort to uphold alliances with nearby kingdoms and boost trade and business in the area.

She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television.

Twenty M\u0101ori or part-M\u0101ori players joined the squad; five P\u0101keh\u0101 (white New Zealand) players were added after the team lost to Auckland. Due to the inclusion of these P\u0101keh\u0101 players the team was renamed from the \"New Zealand Maori\" to the \"New Zealand Native Football Representatives\". The final squad comprised 26 players (including Warbrick); of these at least five were full-blooded M\u0101ori, while fourteen had a M\u0101ori mother and a P\u0101keh\u0101 father.

Their last New Zealand match before departure, against Otago played in Dunedin on 31 July 1888, was won by one try to nil. The team sailed for Australia from Dunedin, leaving on 1 August 1888. In Melbourne, Scott recruited Jack Lawlor to train the players in Victorian Rules football in Britain as preparation for possible Victorian Rules matches on their return to Australia. The team played two rugby matches against the Melbourne Rugby Union team, winning the first and drawing the second, before continuing to Britain via Suez. They arrived in London on 27 September 1888. The team were met in Britain by local rugby administrators, including an official of England's Rugby Football Union (RFU).

Al was a welder for pipe construction companies and Evelyn was a field office manager. Noticing that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe, Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway. To market this invention, he founded Richmond Manufacturing, which eventually exported machines worldwide. Tim's driving days started as a toddler when he was given a go-kart that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn. He later raced the kart at tracks in Moreland and New Pittsburg. Richmond grew up in a well-to-do family, and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates, so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami, Florida.

While home in Ohio over a summer break, he met local drag racer Raymond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller. When Richmond reached age 16, his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am, a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said, \"Tim was lazy...\", and \"... I did everything for him. I ruined him, I admit it.

{"prefix": "A third RAAF unit, No. 2 Squadron RAAF, flying Canberra bombers, was sent in 1967, and four RAN destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam.", "gold": "The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November 1970. As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal, and 1 ATF ceased operations in October. Meanwhile, the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of Gough Whitlam. The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973. The Vietnam War was Australia's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support, as the nation's military involvement increased a vocal anti-war movement developed. More than 50,000 Australians served in Vietnam; 519 were killed and 2,398 were wounded. Four were awarded the Victoria Cross. Although the importance of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The Whitlam Labor Government subsequently amalgamated the five defence ministries (Defence, Navy, Army, Air Force, and Supply) into a single Department of Defence in 1973, while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished. On 1 January 1976, the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified, all-volunteer, professional force known as the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Today, the ADF is headquartered at Russell Offices in Canberra and is divided into Air, Land, Maritime and Special Operations Commands. In addition, Northern Command is based in Darwin, and is responsible for operations in Northern Australia. Until the 1970s, Australia's military strategy centred on the concept of Forward Defence, in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co-operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia's region.", "text1": "By the end of 1967, Australia's military involvement in Vietnam had grown significantly, with over 4,000 personnel serving on the ground and in the air. In addition to No. 2 Squadron RAAF and the RAN destroyers, No. 9 Squadron RAAF, flying Iroquois helicopters, was also deployed to Vietnam. The helicopters were used to transport troops, supplies, and casualties, as well as conduct medical evacuations.\n\nAs the conflict escalated, the Australian government increased its commitment to the war effort. In 1968, the Australian Army's 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) arrived in Vietnam, followed by 3 RAR in 1969. The two battalions were deployed to Phuoc Tuy Province, where they conducted operations against the Viet Cong and assisted in the construction of roads, bridges, and other infrastructure.\n\nAustralia's naval contribution also continued to grow, with the deployment of two more RAN destroyers, HMAS Hobart and HMAS Quadrant, in 1968. The ships joined US Navy and South Vietnamese naval vessels in patrolling the waters off North Vietnam and providing gunfire support to ground troops.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Australia's military involvement in Vietnam had peaked, with over 7,000 personnel serving in the country. The conflict took a heavy toll on Australian society, with opposition to the war growing and protests becoming more frequent. In 1972, the Australian government announced that it would withdraw its troops from Vietnam, and by 1973, all Australian combat troops had been withdrawn. However, Australia continued to provide military and economic aid to South Vietnam until the fall of Saigon in 1975.", "text2": "In 1968, the Australian contribution to the war effort further expanded when a detachment of RAAF CH-47D Chinook helicopters arrived at Nui Diep, a base in southern South Vietnam, to support Australian troops operating in the region. The Chinooks provided vital airlift support, including transporting troops and supplies, and also conducted casualty evacuations.\n\nMeanwhile, the RAN continued to play a key role in the naval aspect of the conflict, with its four destroyers joining other Allied warships in the Gulf of Tonkin to intercept and attack North Vietnamese naval forces. The Australians also contributed to the mining of the North Vietnamese ports of Haiphong and Hon Gay in an effort to restrict supplies reaching the communist forces.\n\nBack in Australia, the debate over involvement in the conflict remained divisive, with many Australians opposing the government's decision to send troops to Vietnam. The movement against the war gained momentum, with widespread protest marches and civil unrest throughout the country. Despite these challenges, the Australian government maintained its commitment to the conflict, and its military personnel continued to play a crucial role in the fighting that would eventually claim the lives of over 500 Australian service members.", "text3": "In 1968, Australia increased their involvement in the war by sending RAAF CH-47D Chinook helicopters to Nui Diep in southern South Vietnam to assist Australian troops.

At the same time, the Royal Australian Navy remained actively involved in the war by deploying its destroyers to the Gulf of Tonkin to engage North Vietnamese naval forces.

The decision to send troops to Vietnam continued to spark controversy in Australia, with a significant portion of the population opposing the government's actions.

The ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended. Edson and Thomas tried to persuade Vandegrift to move forces to defend the ridge, but Vandegrift refused, believing that the Japanese were more likely to attack along the coast. Finally, Thomas convinced Vandegrift that the ridge was a good location for Edson's Raiders to \"rest\" from their actions of the preceding month. On 11 September, the 840 men of Edson's unit\u2014including the 1st Raiders and the Paramarines\u2014deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it. Kawaguchi's Center Body of troops was planning to attack the Lunga perimeter at the ridge, which they called \"the centipede\" (mukade gata) because of its shape. On 9 September, Kawaguchi's troops left the coast at Koli Point. Split into four columns, they marched into the jungle towards their predesignated attack points south and southeast of the airfield. Lack of good maps, at least one faulty compass, and thick, almost impenetrable jungle caused the Japanese columns to proceed slowly and zigzag, costing a lot of time. At the same time, Oka's troops approached the Lunga perimeter from the west. Oka had some intelligence on the Marine defenses, extracted from a U.S. Army pilot captured on 30 August. During the day of 12 September, Kawaguchi's troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night's attacks. Kawaguchi wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by 14:00, but they did not reach their assembly areas until after 22:00. Oka was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west. Only the Kuma battalion reported that they were in place on time. Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions, Kawaguchi was still confident in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses.

They're planning to attack us, and we need to be prepared.\"\n\nThe officers nodded in agreement, their minds racing with the possibilities. They knew that the Japanese were known for their aggressive tactics and were capable of launching a surprise attack at any moment.\n\nVandegrift continued, \"We need to fortify our positions, increase patrols, and be prepared to respond quickly to any attack. I want our artillery to be ready to fire at a moment's notice, and our infantry to be prepared to move out at a moment's notice. We can't let the Japanese catch us off guard again.\"\n\nThe meeting ended with a sense of purpose and determination.

Richmond grew up in Ashland, Ohio. His parents, Al and Evelyn (n\u00e9e Warner) Richmond, met in the course of their work.

The game has been ported a number of times, and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media. It is often cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrolling\u2013platform video game. The gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. The levels are populated with hazards in the form of robots inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Destroying a robot frees the creature, but is not necessary to complete the game. The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by moving walls or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents. Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rapidly spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or by rolling on the ground. At the start of the game, the player is given three lives, each of which may be lost if Sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects while in possession of no rings, falls to the bottom of the level screen, or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Signposts act as checkpoints to allow Sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life. The time resets when he returns to the checkpoint. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player may return to the beginning of the act with three lives if the player has any continues. Scattered around each level are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life.

This was the last monument erected at Tikal before the city finally fell into silence. The former satellites of Tikal, such as Jimbal and Uaxactun, did not last much longer, erecting their final monuments in 889. By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal's population had deserted the city, its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city's ceremonial plazas. The squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non-utilitarian items such as musical instruments. These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities, far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them. Some monuments were vandalized and some were moved to new locations. Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared, with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for jade and the easier-to-find tombs were looted. After 950, Tikal was all but deserted, although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed among the ruins. Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the rainforest claimed the ruins for the next thousand years. Some of Tikal's population may have migrated to the Peten Lakes region, which remained heavily populated in spite of a plunge in population levels in the first half of the 9th century. The most likely cause of collapse at Tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure.

The Mongol Empire first arrived at the doorstep of the Pagan Empire in 1252 by invading the Dali Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China.", "gold": "The Mongol armies captured the capital, Dali, on 7 January 1253, and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by 1257. The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song. For the next dozen years, they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land, which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India. The Mongols set up military garrisons, manned mostly by Turkic-speaking Muslims from Central Asia, in 37 circuits of the former Dali Kingdom. By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward appearances of calmness, had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258\u201360 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy. The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols. When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy.", "text1": "The Pagan Empire, fearing the Mongol threat, quickly rallied its armies and marched to defend its southern border. The Dali Kingdom, already weakened by internal conflicts and external pressures, was unable to resist the Mongol onslaught. By 1253, the Mongols had captured the strategic city of Dali, which lay at the confluence of the Mekong and Yangtze rivers. The Pagan Empire, determined to protect its interests, launched a counterattack, but the Mongols had established a strong foothold in the region and were able to hold off the Pagan forces. The Mongols then began to push deeper into Pagan territory, capturing key cities and towns, and sowing chaos and destruction in their wake. The Pagan Empire, realizing that it could not match the Mongols' military might, decided to negotiate a treaty, agreeing to pay tribute to the Mongols and accept their sovereignty over the region.

That year the highway's speed limits were raised to between Wakefield and Iron River as well as between Rapid River and St. Ignace. In 2020, MDOT announced the slight relocation of US 2 in Mackinac County just west of the Cut River Bridge due to sinkholes and shoreline erosion on Lake Michigan near the roadway.

Bohn, a prominent local citizen who later served in Congress from 1927 to 1933. In 1929, the residents of Escanaba created a memorial to the veterans of World War I called Memory Lane. The project consisted of elm and maple trees planted along US 2/US 41 west of town. The American Legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers. Later in 1949, the Bessemer Women's Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans. Also called Memory Lane, the group planted 140 elms and 1,840 evergreens, trees and shrubs as a landscaped parkway along of US 2 east of Bessemer. Most of US 2, along with US 23 in the Lower Peninsula, was designated the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in 1949. To connect the gap in the routing where US 2 cuts through Wisconsin, M\u201195 and M\u201169 were used in place of US 2 between Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls. Signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor George W. Romney had them installed.

{"prefix": "Settlers from New England arrived equally determined to keep it out. Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort Scott: Free-Soil at the Fort Scott Hotel and Pro-Slavery at the Western Hotel.", "gold": "Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery, but those outside the town tended to the free-soil side. During this time, there were local incidents of murder and attempted arson, typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting. During the American Civil War, the fort was renewed as a US military post. In August 1861, the Union Army took command of Fort Scott, and readied it for the war times. The United States Army also took over several blocks within the town for commissary and quartermaster functions. The Union Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners. Troops from Indiana, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, and Wisconsin would come to the fort, and either stayed by the fort, or traveled farther, to subjugate Missouri, Arkansas, or the Indian Territory. Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the United States Colored Troops of the Union Army. A major supply depot was situated at the fort. Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town, but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek. The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern-sympathizing area and close to the Confederate state of Arkansas and the \"unstable\" Indian Territory (present-day state of Oklahoma), where many of the members of the Five Civilized Tribes were allied with the Confederates. The fort served as a \"general hospital\" (large military hospital) and prison until after the war. Following the end of the war, in October 1865 the US Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled. On January 14, 1870, the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas. The Post was based at Fort Scott, but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks, and seldom used the original fort. They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers. Some of the latter feared that the railroad, which had been awarded land for development by the US Government in rights-of-way, would evict them from their squatter homes. The settlers considered the troops lackeys to the railroads, and lumped both as enemies. Settlers also had some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurgents using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery. By the spring of 1873, the US Army withdrew the troops from Fort Scott for good.", "text1": "As the days turned into weeks, the tension between the two factions grew, with each side trying to outmaneuver the other. The Free-Soil settlers, mostly from New England, were adamant that Kansas would remain a free state, while the Pro-Slavery settlers, mostly from the South, were determined to bring slavery to the new territory.\n\nOne night, a group of Pro-Slavery supporters, fueled by whiskey and a sense of righteousness, decided to take matters into their own hands. They sneaked out of the Western Hotel and made their way to the Fort Scott Hotel, intent on forcing the Free-Soil settlers to abandon their claims. But the Free-Soil settlers were not about to back down without a fight.\n\nLed by a fiery young woman named Emily Taylor, the Free-Soil settlers armed themselves with rifles and pitchforks and prepared to defend their hotel against the Pro-Slavery aggressors. The night air was filled with the sound of shouting, pounding fists, and the gleam of metal as the two factions clashed in a frenzy of anger and fear.\n\nJust as it seemed that the Pro-Slavery supporters were about to break through the Free-Soil defenses, a group of U.S. marshals, who had been sent to Fort Scott to maintain order, arrived on the scene. With the threat of arrest hanging over their heads, the Pro-Slavery supporters slowly retreated back to their hotel, leaving the Free-Soil settlers victorious but battered.\n\nThe confrontation at the Fort Scott Hotel was just the beginning of the bloodiest chapter in the Bleeding Kansas conflict, and the tensions between the two factions would only continue to escalate in the months and years to come.", "text2": "As tensions escalated, the two groups began to take drastic measures to assert their authority over the town.

The atmosphere at Fort Scott became increasingly hostile, with rumors of armed confrontations spreading like wildfire.\n\nOn one particularly tense night, a group of Free-Soil settlers gathered in the Fort Scott Hotel's common room to share stories of their struggles and grievances. As they spoke, a loud knock came at the door, and a figure dressed in dark clothing and a wide-brimmed hat slipped into the room. He was a known sympathizer of the pro-slavery cause, and his sudden appearance sent shivers down the spines of the assembled settlers. \"You people should know,\" he sneered, \"that you're only temporary visitors to this territory. We'll be the ones governing it soon, and you can either get on board or get out.\"\n\nThe room fell silent, with all eyes fixed on the stranger. The tension was palpable, and it seemed as though a fight might break out at any moment. Yet just then, a burly settler, a former sailor from New England, stood up and took a step forward. \"We may be outsiders here,\" he growled, \"but we won't back down from a fight. We've got as much right to be here as you do.\" The stranger snarled in response, but before violence could erupt, a commotion outside interrupted the stalemate. The sounds of gunfire and shouting came from the direction of the Western Hotel, and all heads turned to gaze out the window to see what was happening.\n\nWhat had started that night in the dimly lit hotel would eventually spark a chain reaction of events that would forever change the course of Bleeding Kansas...", "text3": "The two groups started to take extreme actions to show their control over the town as tensions rose.

While they were talking, there was a sudden loud knock on the door, and a mysterious figure in dark clothing and a wide-brimmed hat entered the room. His sudden arrival, as a supporter of the pro-slavery movement, made the settlers feel uneasy. He sneered and reminded the settlers that they were just temporary visitors in the territory. Either join us in governing or leave. The stranger's entrance caused a hush to fall over the room as everyone stared at him. The atmosphere was tense, with the threat of violence looming. However, at that moment, a strong settler, who used to be a sailor from New England, rose and moved closer. \"We may not be from around here, but we're not afraid to stand our ground,\" he snarled. We have just as much of a claim to this place as you do. Before any violence could break out, a disturbance outside disrupted the tense situation.

{"prefix": "Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period. The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains.", "gold": "The oval-shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the Oregon\u2013Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains. It is about long and wide. The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene. A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure. The caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago. The caldera contains significant ore deposits, and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera. Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. The Trout Creek Mountains are semi-arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range, most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the Trout Creek Mountains. As a result, the average annual precipitation in the Trout Creek Mountains is only per year, with most areas receiving between annually. Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June. Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months. Snowpack at elevations below usually melts by April; however, at the higher elevations, snow can remain until mid-June. Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the snowpack melts. The prevailing winds are from the west-southwest, and they are normally strongest in March and April. Brief, intense thunderstorms are common between April and October. Thunderstorms in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes. Vegetation in the Trout Creek Mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses. Other common shrubs include bitterbrush, snowberry, and Ceanothus. There are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas. Common grass species include Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, cheatgrass, western needlegrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail, as well as basin wildrye in some well-drained areas. Less than one percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian greenways (vegetation along stream banks). However, these areas are vital to the local ecosystem.", "text1": "These intrusive bodies have been extensively altered by hydrothermal fluids, resulting in the formation of numerous epithermal veins and porphyry copper deposits. The diorite and granodiorite units have also been subjected to intense contact metamorphism, resulting in the development of high-grade metamorphic rocks such as quartzite and marbles. The McDermitt Caldera, a 15-kilometer-wide volcanic complex, is thought to have formed as a result of the collapse of a large magma chamber during the Eocene Epoch, approximately 50 million years ago. The caldera's walls are now exposed, revealing a sequence of volcanic rocks including ash flows, lava flows, and domes. The Trout Creek Mountains have also been affected by tectonic activity, with evidence of folding, faulting, and uplift suggesting a complex history of deformation. The area's geology is of great interest to geologists and mining companies, given its potential for hosting economic deposits of copper, gold, and other valuable minerals.", "text2": "These volcanic rocks were formed as a result of immense explosive eruptions, producing ash and gas clouds that traveled thousands of miles, depositing a thick layer of tuff and volcanic ash across the region. The caldera's rim is formed by a ring-shaped range of mountains, with the Trout Creek Valley situated within its inner rim. The caldera's eastern slope is characterized by a unique geological feature, the McDermitt Butte, a composite volcanic cone that rises over 1,500 meters above the surrounding landscape. The butte is composed of intercalated layers of rhyolitic and dacitic rocks, resulting from a mix of magma chamber interactions and gas-rich eruptions. The remnants of ancient volcanic ash and pumice deposits are scattered across the region, providing valuable clues about the region's complex geological history, including its role as a conduit for early Cenozoic volcanic activity.", "text3": "Immense explosive eruptions created these volcanic rocks, spreading ash and gas clouds over thousands of miles and depositing a thick layer of tuff and volcanic ash in the area.

Andrew Stoddart, who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the 1888 British Isles side, played for the club in their 9\u20133 defeat to the Natives. The New Zealanders won having scored four tries, including two by Keogh. Their next opposition was a United Services side mainly comprising Royal Navy players. The Natives were again victorious, this time 10\u20130. The match against Oxford University was postponed due to heavy frost, and so the team had a seven-day break from playing \u2013 their longest of the tour.

The team manager, Scott, was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played \u2013 the RFU were adamant that the match should take place at Blackheath's ground, but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval, where a larger crowd, and therefore higher gate receipts, could be secured. The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the profit-making motives of the Natives, and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue. The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home Unions over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB). Following a disputed try in an England\u2013Scotland international match in 1888, the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game, but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote, arguing that they deserved this as they were, they asserted, the senior body, and had the most member clubs. Ireland, Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891, when, following arbitration, the RFU relented and joined the IRFB. The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the Natives on 16 February 1889. The line-ups selected for the 16 February match were both strong, and close to full strength. Though 12 of the England side had not played internationally before, all were experienced at domestic level. The match was refereed by Rowland Hill, who had also officiated the Natives' first match in Britain, against Surrey. The opening of the first half was a scoreless affair, with much tackling and scrummaging on the heavy ground.

This was the last monument erected at Tikal before the city finally fell into silence. The former satellites of Tikal, such as Jimbal and Uaxactun, did not last much longer, erecting their final monuments in 889. By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal's population had deserted the city, its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city's ceremonial plazas. The squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non-utilitarian items such as musical instruments. These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities, far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them. Some monuments were vandalized and some were moved to new locations. Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared, with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for jade and the easier-to-find tombs were looted. After 950, Tikal was all but deserted, although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed among the ruins. Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the rainforest claimed the ruins for the next thousand years. Some of Tikal's population may have migrated to the Peten Lakes region, which remained heavily populated in spite of a plunge in population levels in the first half of the 9th century.

Lack of strong leadership led to frequent resource disputes and increased raids from neighboring regions taking advantage of Tikal's vulnerability. By the end of the 10th century, the former hub of Mayan influence and civilization had deteriorated significantly. The once majestic structures that once stood tall were now falling apart and deserted, overgrown with vegetation. The traditional ceremonies and practices that were once a significant part of Tikal's culture had faded into obscurity, and the renowned astronomers of the city had disappeared without a trace. The legacy of Tikal endured despite its downfall. Many locals boasted of possessing ancient artifacts and knowledge inherited from generations past, as tales of the city's former greatness persisted in legend. Despite the deteriorating ruins, the city's memory was preserved through these tales, while the structures became habitats for various wildlife. The tales of Tikal evolved into myths and legends, showcasing the city's lasting impact and the remarkable accomplishments of humanity. The city's rich history and culture remained a source of fascination for historians, archaeologists, and tourists, sparking interest in future generations to delve deeper into the legacy of this ancient civilization and its global influence.", "detect1": {"z_score": -0.24618298195866545, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.49242424242424243, "p_value": 0.5972297056662531}, "detect2": {"z_score": 11.1555211520535, "prediction": true, "green_fraction": 0.7907608695652174, "p_value": 3.3648664235254864e-29}, "detect3": {"z_score": 1.5954480704349312, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.5454545454545454, "p_value": 0.05530603687426152}, "curr_idx": 498}
{"prefix": "At the fort, Moultrie ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man-of-war ships, Bristol and Experiment, which took hit after hit from the fort's guns. Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main- and mizzenmasts.", "gold": "One round hit her quarterdeck, slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh. The shot also tore off part of his britches, leaving his backside exposed. By mid-afternoon, the defenders were running out of gunpowder, and their fire was briefly suspended. However, Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland, and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day, telling Colonel Moultrie, \"I see you are doing very well here, you have no occasion for me, I will go up to the town again.\" Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort's walls with persistent broadside cannonades. This strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions; the structure would quiver, and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering. The exchange continued until around 9:00 pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range. At one point during the battle, the flag Moultrie had designed and raised over the fort was shot down. Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again, holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided. He was credited by Moultrie with reviving the troops' spirits, and later given commendations for bravery. A painting of this event (pictured above) depicts Jasper's actions. Counting casualties, Parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard Bristol, which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to the hull, yards, and rigging. Experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded. Active and Solebay reported 15 casualties each. The Americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded. The following morning, the British, unable to drag the grounded Acteon off the sandbar, set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Patriots in small boats sailed out to the burning ships, and fired some of their cannons at the British ships, took what stores and loot they could, and retreated shortly before the ship's powder magazine exploded. The British did not attempt to take the fort again.", "text1": "As the sun began to set on the battle-scarred waters, the crew of the Bristol and Experiment were in a desperate state. The chain shot had left their ships crippled, with tangled rigging and masts lying across the decks. The British ships, once so proud and formidable, now limped and wallowed in the water, unable to effectively respond to the fierce cannonade from the fort.\n\nDespite their wounded state, the British commanders refused to give up. They ordered their crews to continue fighting, hoping to somehow turn the tide of the battle. But the Americans, sensing their advantage, redoubled their efforts, pouring even more cannonballs into the beleaguered ships.\n\nAs the darkness deepened, the sounds of battle grew more muted. The British ships, their crews exhausted and demoralized, slowly drifted away from the fort, their once-proud flags now torn and tattered. The Americans, their guns still blazing, watched with a mixture of relief and triumph as their enemies retreated into the night, their plans foiled and their ships badly damaged.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Moultrie and his men would celebrate a hard-won victory, their bravery and skill having saved the city from the British threat. But they would also know that their work was far from over - the war was far from won, and the British would likely return, seeking revenge and retribution for their defeat.", "text2": "As the day wore on, the British fleet continued to pound the fort, but Moultrie's men refused to give up. Despite the heavy bombardment, the fort's walls remained intact, and its gunners maintained their steady barrage on the two flagship man-o' wars. The Experiment suffered significant damage as well, with several balls piercing her hull and starting fires in the hold.\n\nMeanwhile, the British ships were beginning to show signs of fatigue, with many of their sails in shambles and their masts creaking ominously under the weight of the chain shot. The South Carolininans sensed their advantage and poured on the artillery fire, targeting the rigging and mainmast of the largest ships.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, the British fleet was in disarray, with several vessels limping out of range or listing badly from the constant pounding. The Experiment, her hull severely damaged, anchored nearby, her crew frantically trying to extinguish the fires burning in the hold.\n\nMoultrie's men, sensing victory within their grasp, raised a triumphant cry and poured yet more fire onto the struggling fleet. As the day drew to a close, the British fleet retreated, leaving behind several destroyed or damaged ships and a wounded but unbowed South Carolininans' fort, proud of their hard-won victory.", "text3": "Throughout the day, the British fleet kept attacking the fort, but Moultrie's soldiers remained determined. The fort's walls stayed strong despite the relentless attacks, and its gunners continued to fire at the enemy ships. The Experiment sustained substantial damage, including multiple shots penetrating its hull and igniting fires below deck. At the same time, the British ships were starting to display weariness, as numerous sails were torn and their masts groaned under the strain of the chain shot. The South Carolinians recognized their upper hand and intensified their artillery fire, focusing on the rigging and mainmast of the biggest vessels. In the afternoon, the British fleet was in chaos, with some ships either retreating or heavily damaged from the continuous attacks. The Experiment, with significant damage to its hull, was docked close by as the crew worked urgently to put out the fires below deck. Moultrie's soldiers, feeling confident in their impending success, cheered loudly and increased their artillery fire on the struggling British fleet. At the end of the day, the British fleet withdrew, leaving behind damaged and destroyed ships, while the South Carolinians' fort stood strong and proud after their hard-fought triumph.", "detect1": {"z_score": 0.11826247919781652, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.5034965034965035, "p_value": 0.45292984299085737}, "detect2": {"z_score": 10.995882591327726, "prediction": true, "green_fraction": 0.8377358490566038, "p_value": 1.9999055594767627e-28}, "detect3": {"z_score": 1.9968855418425755, "prediction": false, "green_fraction": 0.5643153526970954, "p_value": 0.022918809074469294}, "curr_idx": 499}
