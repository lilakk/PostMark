There is agreement that such clashes took place, that they involved considerable violence, and that European settlement was responsible for the demise of the Aborigines. After the arrival of Europeans, Aborigines suffered from the spread of disease and loss of traditional ways of life. But the full destruction of the Aborigines was due mainly to the frontier wars.\nThough of limited use in these early times, it nevertheless left a legacy for generations to come. Aborigines lived in tribal societies based on the nuclear family. The tribe, sometimes consisting of a hundred or more people, was divided into small family groupings that camped in sites about the size of a football field. The men were hunters, and they often conducted large-scale hunts of kangaroos and wallabies. The women gathered fruits, roots, and insects, as well as gathering and grinding into flour the seeds of local grasses and bushes. Most Aborigines practised both circumcision and clitoridectomy in their initiation rites for boys and girls.

In the early years of the conquest, isolation was the key element of their perception. Even when adjustments were made in British understandings of Aboriginal hunting-gathering, they generally still assumed that this way of life had been typical of groups pre-contact Aborigines.\nEuropeans would also ascribe explanations to Aboriginal want of centralized leadership, focus, or organization in raids.

{"prefix": "The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied, but were inevitably hostile when the settlers' presence led to competition over resources, and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants' lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation.", "text1": "These land changes severely altered the cultures and societies of Australia's original inhabitants. To the first settlers, the presence of these indigenous populations were seen as a threat to their colonial ambitions, leading to laws forbidding contact between settlers and Aboriginal peoples. At first, the settlers hoped that either disease or the introduction of alcohol would prove sufficient to remove the Aboriginal people; later, policies of forced segregation or removal were adopted. Even when Aboriginal peoples accepted conversion to Christianity, their legal rights and status were not increased. Christian missions and reserves were established; these had the benefit of reducing contact with settlers, but the institutions themselves imposed a highly restrictive lifestyle upon the inhabitants. Some reservations were so restrictive that it became impossible to continue the traditional ceremonies, the land, and the lifestyle of the original inhabitants; other missions were founded as a result of the initiative of Aboriginal communities, or to provide educational opportunities. Attempts to Christianize Aboriginal peoples were made in several different ways. Initially, missionaries focused on the eradication of traditional Aboriginal religions and belief systems, with some missionaries seeing no contradiction between the destruction of Aboriginal religions and the continuance of traditional lifestyles. Other missionaries were more willing to focus on improving the material conditions of the indigenous people, or on the revival of their own culture.

One mechanistic possibility for this process involves nucleophilic ring-opening of the epoxide to form a cis-alkoxyallyl cation, which can collapse by two possible mechanisms. The oxyallyl cation ( 1 ) can be intercepted by a thiol and then arylated by a copper salt. This approach allows one to prepare non-phenolic quercetin analogs.

{"prefix": "From the mid-1990s onward, press articles, reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis, accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience.

Scientology, they imagine, is an irrational, dangerous cult, with a pathological leader and deluded members. The current state of affairs, however, is not the result of a sudden anti-cult scare in Germany but a legacy of the country's history. For the history of the church there is nothing \"unusual\" about the persistent rejection of Scientology in Germany. The criticism levelled at the church since the mid-1990s, which sees it as one of the most harmful and dangerous religious groups, is fundamentally consistent with earlier, historical debates over religious pluralism.", "text2": "In other words, for mass media as well as parts of the anti-cult and even theological milieus, Scientology acquired the status of an authoritarian movement. Blaming Scientology as the prime culprit in a supposed \"destabilisation of society\", \"cult opponents\" demanded the eradication of the group. In response to this situation, Scientology shifted its public relations strategy. In 1994, Hubbard died and his wife, Mary Sue, took over the chairmanship of the Church's worldwide operations. Through a policy of friendly but controlled appearances, Mary Sue tried to give the movement a less forbidding and even more human-looking face. After the introduction of a milder policy of interaction with the media, contributors in the press also developed a more positive attitude toward Church; Michael Baigent and Henry Funn, for instance, published a book on the person and work of L. Ron Hubbard which they called a \"surprising rediscovery\" (Baigent 2000). However, the anti-cult camp still refused to change its fundamental attitude toward the group. An unusual meeting of minds occurred at the turn of the millennium when the Brothers of Charity in Belgium softened its stigmatizing language, recognizing that Scientology was a \"new and extreme variant of latent traditional trends within Christianity\" and was characterized by \"spiritual bribery\". After the turn of the millennium, Scientology also had some success in challenging anti-cult groups, which, in turn, intensified the attack.", "text3": "Mass media, anti-cult groups, and theological circles all viewed Scientology as an authoritarian movement. \"Cult opponents\" called for the elimination of Scientology, accusing it of causing societal destabilization. Scientology changed its approach to public relations in reaction to the criticism. After Hubbard's death in 1994, his wife Mary Sue assumed leadership of the Church's global activities. Mary Sue attempted to present Scientology in a more approachable and relatable manner by carefully managing public appearances. The media started to view the Church of Scientology more positively after a change in policy, with authors like Michael Baigent and Henry Funn even publishing a book praising L. Ron Hubbard. Nevertheless, the opposition to cults remained steadfast in their negative stance towards the organization.

Many Aborigines were killed in combat, but many more died from disease or starvation.\nFollowing the Myall Creek Massacre of 1838, it became an offence under British law to murder an Aborigine. The law applied in New South Wales, but not in the other Australian colonies. In 1841, the Crown Land Act of Victoria was passed which extended the ban on massacres to Victoria. These laws were not effective, however. In 1838, Europeans murdered 100 Aborigines in the Port Phillip District. A commission of inquiry was conducted, but none of the suspects were charged. A number of local pastoralists and squatters were fined for failing to control their servants, but none of the perpetrators were found guilty.\nIn 1849, 11 Aborigines were killed near Portland, Victoria. However, none of the suspects were found guilty. The killing of an Aborigine was not considered a serious offence. In 1853, when a group of Aborigines were speared near Benalla, Victoria, the squatter was found guilty of killing one Aborigine and sentenced to three months imprisonment.", "text2": "As a result, the choice of offensive armament tended to depend on factors such as cost, proximity to population centres, and relative ease of use. These often meant that medieval and later trade weapons were used long after they had been left behind by European armies. Throughout colonial times and well into the post-colonial period, the Derringer, the percussion cap single-shot pistol, and various short-barreled, chambered breech-action rifles including the Winchester rifle and carbines, made by rivals such as the Marlin rifle, were popular with the colonists. These firearms were known for their versatility and killing power.\nExplorers found mostly pre-19th century muskets were often found at the end of insurrections as relics or hidden in cupboards or other secret locations. Like the North Americans (excepting the extreme south), the Australian Aborigines did not have access to gunpowder firearms but did use a variety of weapons for hunting and what could be termed lightweight warfare. It was alleged that firearms had the capacity to be more effective against Aboriginal people than any other weapon they had ever faced.\nOf course, apart from the already noted types of firearms, mainly smooth-bore muskets, that were imported during the colonial period as trade goods, as well as the abovementioned rifles and pistols, the second most used types of firearms were traditional muzzle-loading flintlock muskets and sidearms.", "text3": "Therefore, the selection of offensive weapons often relied on considerations like cost, distance to populated areas, and simplicity of operation.

From the reactants in base catalyzed Nazarov cyclizations, the most likely candidate is the aldehyde of enantiopure configuration, this is always equal to X.

These authors developed a CuCl-Alkylguanidine catalyst that was able to effect the enantioselective 2-methoxylation of an aryl alkyne.[10] The CuCl-alkylguanidine catalyst gave similar results to a CuCl-salt-amine complex catalyst developed by the same group. A variant of this catalyst system used a CuCl-cyclohexylphenylglycine ligand to effect the enantioselective 1-methoxylation of aryl alkynes.[11] A similar catalyst developed by Lin and coworkers was also capable of effecting the 1-methoxylation of aryl alkynes.[12] This catalyst system allowed the coupling reaction to proceed using an extremely low catalyst loading (0.0015 mol%) with high levels of enantioselectivity.\nThe Kumada coupling was a reaction promoted by Itoh and coworkers that was thought to proceed with racemization of the product (_R_)-1.", "text2": "Most efforts to develop an asymmetric variant of the reaction have focused on controlling the stereoselectivity of the deprotonation step via the use of chiral promoters,[2, 3] leading to the development of some of the more well-known reactions such as the Peterson olefination and the Narasaka reaction.[3] However, the challenge of designating the unique stereocenters dictated by a more complex asymmetric elimination has recently evinced projects focused on more direct approaches to stereocontrol.\nRecent research has shown that the use of sterically hindered and non-nucleophilic promoter has the potential to lead to an asymmetric variant of the reaction if no racemization is made to occur. New alkoxide promoters, such as FASKA,[4] PNPA,[5] SEMTHS,[6] and benzylamide[7] have been shown to perform selective initial deprotonation of a racemic _B_-hydroxysteme.

Once charged, the Spin Dash can also be used as a launch maneuver, providing more vertical distance than a simple jump.

The front end had already been disconnected from the rig, so I decided it was a good time to start re-engineering it. I began by flipping over the rear transom area to work on it. The transom required the mast fitting to be lowered slightly in preparation for the lugsail mast. There's nothing quite like a deep burn on the crease of the palm. My old trees didn't shed their leaves properly in the fall, so they often have pests. The issue with the hole at the bottom of the mast trunk was not as common as the one in the cabin trunk. Trees in the south typically live for 3 to 5 years. The tree that was cut down tonight may live up to 5 years, but it could also happen at 4 years without appearing natural. After removing all the wood from the Westerly, it was quite simple to divide it into different parts. Based on what has been done already, I plan to work on the exterior planking next, then move on to the interior joinery and finish everything at once. Maintaining the paint on the outside.
